## Essay
The reading and lecture are both about whether the dinosaurs are endotherms which keep the body temperatures. The author of the reading feels that  the dinosaurs are endotherms according to some evidences, whereas the lecturer challenges the claims made by the author. In short, she is of the opposite opinion that dinosaurs can't maintain their temperature in the cold environment.

To begin with, the author contends that dinosaur fossils has been found in the polar region. The article mentions that only animals that can maintain their body temperatures by themselves can survive in this extreme area. The specific argument is challenged by the lecturer who claims that the polar region in the past may not be as cold as the current. Additionally, she says that dinosaurs could migrate to a warmer place or hibernate even though the weather became worse.

Secondly, the writer suggest that the leg position and movement of dinosaurs is typical body structure of endotherms. In the article, it is said that this kind of position of legs allows lasting activity. The lecturer, however, rebuts this by remarking that this type of appearance has other function. Furthermore, she elaborates on this by bringing up the point that the body structure also allows animals support the weight of themselves and thus dinosaurs may grow to considerable size.

Finally, the author posits that dinosaurs own a bone structure called Haversian canals which endotherms usually have. Moreover, it is stated in the article that these canals assemble nerves and vessels and hence let those animals grow quickly. However, the lecturer's position is that dinosaurs stop, slow the growth in a low temperature even though dinosaurs actually have Haversian canals. She notes that dinosaurs were endotherms if they would grow with a normal speed even in a severe weather.

## Lecture
Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.

Many scientists have problems with the arguments you read in the passage. They don’t think those arguments prove that dinosaurs were endotherms EN-duh-therms.

Take the polar dinosaur argument. When dinosaurs lived, even the *polar regions* where dinosaur fossils have been found were much warmer than today—*warm enough during part of the year* for animals that were not endotherms to live. And *during the months when the polar regions were cold*, the so-called polar dinosaurs could *have migrated to warmer areas or hibernate*d like many modern reptiles do. So the presence of dinosaur fossils in polar regions doesn’t prove the dinosaurs were endotherms.

Well, what about the fact that dinosaurs had their legs placed under their bodies, not out to the side, like a crocodile’s? *That doesn’t necessarily mean dinosaurs were high-energy endotherms built for running*. There’s *another explanation* for having legs under the body: *this body structure supports more weight*. So with the legs under their bodies, dinosaurs could *grow to a very large size*. Being large had advantages for dinosaurs, so we don’t need the idea of endothermy and running to explain why dinosaurs evolved to have their legs under their bodies.

OK, so how about bone structure? Many dinosaur bones do have Haversian huh-VER-zhun canals, that’s true, but *dinosaur bones also have growth rings*. Growth rings are a thickening of the bone that *indicates periods of time when the dinosaurs weren’t rapidly growing.* These growth rings are evidence that dinosaurs *stopped growing or grew more slowly during cooler periods.* This pattern of periodic growth—ya know, rapid growth followed by no growth or slow growth and then rapid growth again—is characteristic of animals that are not endotherms. *Animals that maintain a constant body temperature year* round, as true endotherms do, *grow rapidly even when the environment becomes cool.*

## Passage
*Endotherms* are animals such as modern birds and mammals that *keep their body temperatures constant*. For instance, humans are endotherms and maintain an internal temperature of 37°C, no matter *whether the environment is warm or cold*. Because dinosaurs were reptiles, and modern reptiles are not endotherms, it was long assumed that dinosaurs were not endotherms. However, dinosaurs differ in many ways from modem reptiles, and *there is now considerable evidence that dinosaurs were, in fact, endotherms.*

*Polar* dinosaurs

One reason for believing that dinosaurs were endotherms is that *dinosaur fossils have been discovered in Polar Regions*. *Only animals that can maintain a temperature well above that of the surrounding environment could be active* in such cold climates.

*Leg position and movement*

There is a connection between endothermy and the position and movement of the legs. The physiology of endothermy *allows sustained physical activity*, such as running. But *running is efficient only if an animal's legs are positioned underneath its body,* not at the body's side, as they are for crocodiles and many lizards. *The legs of all modern endotherms are underneath the body, and so were the legs of dinosaurs.* This strongly suggests that dinosaurs were endotherms.

*Haversian canals*

There is also a connection between endothermy and *bone structure*. The bones of endotherms usually include structures called Haversian canals. These *canals house nerves and blood vessels that allow the living animal to grow quickly*, and rapid body growth is in fact a characteristic of endothermy. The presence of Haversian canals in bone is a strong indicator that the animal is an endotherm, and *fossilized bones of dinosaurs are usually dense with Haversian canals.*
