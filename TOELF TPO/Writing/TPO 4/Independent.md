## Essay
Some people argues as if it is a general truth that in the future of twenty years the number of cars will decrease. But to be frank, I can not agree with this supposition. The following discussion reveals my perspective and reasons.

To begin with, there are still no another reliable transportation methods. The cars are still the most common vehicle mainly since they are relatively cheap, even concerning the price and oil fee, and more accessible than other public transportation, such as trains or airplanes which are set to operate on specific time. For example, if you desire to travel to somewhere not a across ocean, you would have multiple choices including planes, trains, long-range bus, or cars. On the other, the options become considerably limited when it comes to a short-distanced journey. Notwithstanding trains and bus also available selections, they are not as convenient as riding a car in terms of accessibility and the time used on waiting the public transportation. 

Secondly, other resources will be invented to replace the excessive requirement of petroleum which is rapidly decreasing in the recent years. Although part of people is worrying the quantity of the deposits and its fatal result, global warming, there are a vast array of countries demanding this sort of energy to boost his finance; And, hence in order to prevent from utilizing it, someone must concoct a kind of substitute fuel to handle the difficulty of nations. Take the possibility as instance, if an institution successfully develop the fuel, it would be more potential that they lower the list price than raise it. Subsequently, the number of cars will rise in that the expense of driving a car declines on a whole. 

Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that there should be more cars in twenty years. Given the fact that cars are the most reliable vehicles and new energy, on the contrary, benefits the sales of cars, the decreasing number of cars is unreachable in twenty years.

Some people argues as if it is a general truth that in the future of twenty years the number of cars will *shrink*. But to be frank, I can not agree with this supposition. The following discussion reveals my perspective and reasons.

To begin with, *other transportation methods are not as much reliable as cars*. The cars are still the most common vehicle mainly since they are relatively cheap, even concerning the price and oil fee, and more accessible than other public transportation, such as trains or airplanes which are set to operate on specific time. For example, if you desire to travel to somewhere not a across ocean, you would have multiple choices including planes, trains, long-range bus, or cars. On the other *hand*, the *alternatives* become considerably *insufficient* when it comes to a *short-distance* journey. Notwithstanding trains and bus *are* also available selections, they are not as convenient as riding a car in terms of accessibility and the time used on waiting the public transportation. *After taking off the train, the station is usually not adjacent to the destination which require you to take another transportation if the physical activity is not acceptable. Train routes might reach more places in the future, but however, in the case, more time will be spent on riding inasmuch as the staying time at each station cannot be reduced.*

Secondly, other resources will be invented to replace the excessive requirement of petroleum which is rapidly *dwindling* in the recent years. Although people is worrying the quantity of the deposits and the fatal *consequence*, global warming, *a vast array of countries still demand* this sort of energy to boost his finance; *and*, hence in order to prevent from *exploit* it, someone must concoct a kind of *alternative* fuel to handle the *plight* of *the* nations. Take the possibility as instance, if an institution successfully develop the fuel, it would be more potential that they lower the list price than raise it. Subsequently, the number of cars will rise in that the expense of driving a car declines on a whole. 

Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that there should be more cars in twenty years. Given the fact that cars are the most reliable vehicles and new energy, on the contrary, benefits the sales of cars, the decreasing number of cars is *impractical* in twenty years.
