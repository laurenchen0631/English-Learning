It is a highly debated issue whether telling the truth is the most pivotal consideration in people's relationship. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that. Among countless factors which support my points, there are two conspicuous aspects as follows.

To begin with, endless relationship is based on trust. Some relationship will meet its end sooner or later, but, however, some friends are maintained for a prolonged time, even forever. In fact, what makes the difference is if the person is trustworthy or not. In other words, you never confide your fear or embarrassment to the one you don't trust. As an illustration of my experience, I lost my friendship when I was still in junior high school. He had been my intimate for nearly 6 years. We always talk about many interesting objects and, also, private affairs until I met a girl and started to pursue her. In that time, I talked a vast array of things that includes mine and, in particular, my intimate's with her. Subsequently, I found that the intimate ceased to talk about any personal secrets with me, and then he finally told that he actually acquaint with the girl that disclose what I had told her. No sooner had we graduated, he hadn't contact me once.

Secondly, knowing the truth of oneself stimulate people to advance. People might not love to listen the truth, but some truth reveal our weakness and hence makes us to improve ourselves. Assuming that a person only ingratiate other people, he or she will lose the confidence of others. Taking my colleague for example, he willingly expose his real opinions wherever the situation, such as a meeting and time of programming, is in. At first, he was disliked by his coworkers including me. After a while, I realized that his advises and judgement are so helpful that I actually ameliorate my personality, not to mention the performance on the job. I would recognize him as my friend even though we don't have any connection out of company.

From the above, my idea that you should got is that telling the truth is the most significant behavior in the relationship. For one thing, telling the truth constructs a permanent relationship. And another thing, telling people the truth helps boosting themselves to achieve to be better. Considering the reasons, there are no factor which is as influential as telling the truth.

It is a highly debated issue whether telling the truth is the most pivotal consideration in people's relationship. As far as I am concerned, I agree with *it*. Among countless factors which support my *contention*, there are two conspicuous aspects as follows.

In fact, what makes the difference is if the person is trustworthy or not. In other words, you never confide your fear or embarrassment to the one you don't trust. As an illustration of my experience, I lost *a long-term friendship* that *associated with my male intimate who hadn't contact me once due to my dishonesty*. *We used to share the thought of many subjects and, also, private things by the time that I pursued a girl who I revealed many things including mine and, also, his for acquiring her affection.* Subsequently, *there are some negative rumors that I didn't acknowledge as my wrongdoing about him*. No sooner had we graduated, he hadn't contact me once. *After a while, I heard that he actually was acquainted* with the girl that disclose what I had told her. **Up to now I still regret that I didn't confess the truth that I leaked his secret.**
