## Essay
The reading and the lecture both discuss about whether some paints is created by Rembrandt or not. The author of the reading feels that there is one such painting shows some suspicious points, whereas the lecturer challenges the claims made by the author. Instead, she is of the opinion that the paint was indeed made by Rembrandt but, however, was changed by someone else.

To begin with, the author argues that the woman's dressing is inconsistent. The articles mentions that the woman in the painting wears a while linen cap that only servants use and also and also wears a luxurious fur collar unaffordable for a mere servant. The is specific argument is challenged by the lecturer. She claims that the fur collar was Rembrandt's work according to X-ray analysis. Additionally, she says that the collar was painted over the top of original painting by someone else who want to raise the value of the painting.

Secondly, the writer suggest that the light and shadow do not fit together in this painting. More importantly, Rembrandt was a master of painting light and shadow. In the article, it is said that the face appears to be illuminated by light reflected onto it from below while below face is the dark fur collar, which would absorb light. The lecturer, however, rebuts this by mentioning that the fur collar is not original part of the painting. She elaborates on this by bringing up the point that the light and shadow are quite realistic after the collar was removed from the woman.

Finally, the author posits that the painting was painted on a panel made of several pieces of wood. Moreover, it is stated in the article that no other Rembrandt's painting is portrayed on this kind of panel. In contrast, the lecturer's position is that the panel was enlarged with extra wood pieces glued to the initial panel. He notes that researchers have found that original panel is same with another painting by Rembrandt.

## Lecture
Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about. 

Everything you just read about “Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet” is true, and yet after a thorough re-examination of the painting, *a panel of experts has recently concluded that it’s indeed a work by Rembrandt*. Here is why. 

First, the *fur collar*. *X-rays and analysis* of the pigments in the paint have shown that the fur collar *wasn’t part of the original painting. The fur collar was painted over the top of the original painting* about a hundred years after the painting was made. Why? *Someone probably wanted to increase the value of the painting* by making it look like a formal portrait of an aristocratic lady. 

Second, the supposed error with light and shadow. Once the paint of the *added fur color was removed*, the original could be seen, in the original painting, *the woman is wearing a simple collar of light-colored cloth*. The light-colored cloth of this collar reflects light that illuminates part of the woman’s face. That’s why the face is not in partial shadow. *So in the original painting, light and shadow are very realistic* and just what we would expect from Rembrandt. 

Finally, the wood panel. It turns out that when the fur collar was added, *the wood panel was also enlarged with extra wood pieces glued to the sides* and the top *to make the painting more grand and more valuable*. So the original painting is actually painted on a single piece of wood, as would be expected from a Rembrandt painting. And in fact, researchers have found that the piece of wood in the original form of “Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet” is from the very same tree as the wood panel used for another painting by Rembrandt, his “Self-portrait with a Hat”.

## Phrase
Rembrandt is the most famous of the seventeenth-century Dutch painters. However, there are doubts whether some paintings attributed to Rembrandt were actually painted by him. One such painting is known as attributed to Rembrandt because of its style, and indeed the representation of the woman’s face is very much like that of portraits known to be by Rembrandt. But there are problems with the painting that suggest it could not be a work by Rembrandt.

First, there is something inconsistent about the way the woman in the portrait is dressed. She is wearing a white linen cap of a kind that only servants would wear-yet the coat she is wearing has a luxurious fur collar that no servant could afford. Rembrandt, who was known for his attention to the details of his subjects’ clothing, would not have been guilty of such an inconsistency.

Second, Rembrandt was a master of painting light and shadow, but in this painting these elements do not fit together. The face appears to be illuminated by light reflected onto it from below. But below the face is the dark fur collar, which would absorb light rather than reflect it. So the face should appear partially in shadow-which is not how it appears. Rembrandt would never have made such an error.

Finally, examination of the back of the painting reveals that it was painted on a panel made of several pieces of wood glued together. Although Rembrandt often painted on wood panels, no painting known to be by Rembrandt uses a panel glued together in this way from several pieces of wood.

For these reasons the painting was removed from the official catalog of Rembrandt’s paintings in the 1930s.
