What do you remember about your life before you were three? [] Few people can remember anything that happened to them in their early years. [] Adults’ memories of the next few years also tend to be scanty. [] Most people remember only a few events—usually ones that were meaningful and distinctive, such as being hospitalized or a sibling’s birth. []

How might this inability to recall early experiences be explained? The *sheer passage of time* does not account for it; adults have excellent recognition of pictures of people who attended high school with them 35 years earlier. Another seemingly **plausible** explanation-that infants do not form enduring memories at this point in development-also is incorrect. Children two and a half to three years old remember experiences that occurred in their first year, and eleven month olds remember some events a year later. Nor does the hypothesis that *infantile amnesia* *reflects repression-or holding back-of sexually charged episodes* explain the **phenomenon**. While such repression may occur, people cannot remember ordinary events from the infant and toddler periods either.

Three other explanations seem more promising. One involves physiological changes relevant to memory. Maturation of the *frontal lobes* of the brain continues throughout early childhood, and this part of the brain may be critical for remembering particular episodes in ways that can be retrieved later. Demonstrations of infants' and toddlers' long-term memory have involved their repeating motor activities that they had seen or done earlier, such as reaching in the dark for objects, putting a bottle in a doll's mouth, or pulling apart two pieces of a toy. The brain's level of physiological maturation may support these types of memories, but not ones requiring explicit verbal descriptions.

A second explanation involves the influence of the social world on children's language use. Hearing and telling stories about events may help children store information in ways that will endure into later childhood and adulthood. Through hearing stories with a clear beginning, middle, and ending children may learn to extract the *gist* of events in ways that they will be able to describe many years later. *Consistent with this view, parents and children increasingly engage in discussions of past events when children are about three years old*. However, hearing such stories is not sufficient for younger children to form enduring memories. Telling such stories to two year olds does not seem to produce long-lasting verbalizable memories.

A third likely explanation for infantile amnesia involves incompatibilities between *the ways in which* infants *encode* information and the ways in which older children and adults retrieve it. Whether people can remember an event depends **critically** on the fit between the way in which they earlier encoded the information and the way in which they later attempt to retrieve it. The better able the person is to reconstruct the **perspective** from which the material was encoded, the more likely that recall will be successful.

This view is supported by a variety of factors that can create *mismatches* between very young children's encoding and older children's and adults' retrieval efforts. The world looks very different to a person whose head is only two or three feet above the ground than to one whose head is five or six feet above it. Older children and adults often try to retrieve the names of things they saw, but infants would not have encoded the information verbally. General knowledge of categories of events such as a birthday party or a visit to the doctor's office helps older individuals encode their experiences, but again, infants and toddlers are unlikely to encode many experiences within such knowledge structures.

These three explanations of infantile amnesia are not mutually exclusive; indeed, they support each other.  **Physiological immaturity may be part of why infants and toddlers do not form extremely enduring memories, even when they hear stories that promote such remembering in *preschoolers*.** Hearing the stories may lead preschoolers to encode aspects of events that allow them to form memories they can access as adults. *Conversely*, improved encoding of what they hear may help them better understand and remember stories and thus make the stories more useful for remembering future events. Thus, all three explanations-physiological maturation, hearing and producing stories about past events, and improved encoding of key aspects of events-seem likely to be involved in overcoming infantile amnesia.

## Review
1. 修辞目的题
	1. 文中没有提及因为没有evidence所以假说不可信，且这不是第二段的目的
	3. 要结合和上下文判定，这一段全否，下面说seem more promising

4. 否定事实信息题
	1. 选项中的time定位至第二句的前半句，这个原因被排除了，所以A对，不选；
	2. 选项中的memories定位至第三句，插入语的内容正是这个选项，原文也认为不合理，所以B对，不选；
	3. 选项中 的sexually meaningful memories定位至倒数第二句，也被排除了，所以C对，不选；
	4. 所以D在原文中似乎没有出现被rejected的内容，而且D选项也符合MOST过于绝对的排除理论。

5. 推理题
	1. 选项很有误导性，错误点在于：Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain is important对于长期记忆很重要，但文章中并没有明确说明是对motor activity 还是verbal descriptions更重要

6. 事实信息题
	3. retrieve memory 是对的，但是文章中没有提到quickly 所以有问题
	4. 後面一句話Through hearing stories with a clear beginning, middle, and ending children may learn to extract the gist of events in ways that they will be able to describe many years later，說明是幫助孩子們理清故事的線索，符合選項中的 ordered structure

11. 句子简化题
	2. 选项里的comprehend错，本篇是说记忆，不是说不能理解故事，没有提到no enduring memory；

14. 主旨题
	3. 对应第三段最后一句“The brain’s level of physiological maturation may support these types of memories, but not ones requiring explicit verbal descriptions. ”，两者间没有相互关系，错误
	4. 因为要记忆久一点，讲故事的時候要有清楚的开始、中间、结尾(clear beginning, middle, and ending)，也就是：”chronologically narrated stories”，按時间順序讲；本篇文章主旨是分析婴儿失忆症原因和如何克服(overcoming infantile amnesia)，所以D不是细节，是重点，是帮助幼儿记忆的方法
	5. 对应第五段最后一句“ The better able the person is to reconstruct the perspective from which the material was encoded, the more likely that recall will be successful. ”，但文中没有描述“content of a memory”，属于out of scope，错误
