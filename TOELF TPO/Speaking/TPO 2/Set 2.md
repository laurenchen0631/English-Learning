## Reason
1. future development (get promoted)
2. mixed application (medical equipment)

## Content
Personally, I believe that getting a broad education is better than focusing on a single subject area for two reasons.

To begin with, it helps students to have more extensive future development opportunity. For instance, if you were an accountant, having management knowledge with a financial background makes you more easily getting promoted as a manager.

Secondly, in some areas, mixed application is required. Taking medical equipment as example, it needs  medical and engineering knowledge. If you own both backgrounds, you would have a higher chance to get into the industry and to be successful.

Because of these reasons, I feel that taking courses in a variety of subject areas is a better choice.

Some college students choose to take courses in a variety of subject areas in order to get a broad education. Others choose to focus on a single subject area in order to have a deeper understanding of that area. Which approach to course selection do you think is better for students and why?
