The reading passage introduces a type of social interaction: audience effects which says individuals' work is affected by others' watching.

The professor explains the idea with a research that prove we tend to increase the speed of performance by being observed. First off, in the research, there are one group that know that they are being observed, and the other groups that doesn't. Compared to their performance at tying shoes, the group knowing the observation have a better performance.

Next, there is also an another behavior shown in the study. It is that the group knowing the observation tend to make more mistakes than the other especially on learning something new. Professor takes typing as example that when we're learning to type and know we're being watched, we'll type faster with more mistakes at the same time.

## Vocab

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to part of a talk in a sociology class. The professor is discussing *audience effects*.
MALE PROFESSOR: OK, so we said that the way we interact with others has an impact on our behavior...
In fact, there's some *interesting research* to suggest that in *one type of interaction—when we're being observed* specifically, when we know we're being watched as we perform some activity—*we tend to increase the speed at which we perform that activity.*
In one study, college students were asked to each put on a pair of shoes—shoes with laces they would have to tie.
Now one group of students was told that they would be observed.
The second group, however, didn't know they were being observed.
The students who were aware that they were being watched actually tied their shoes much faster than the students who thought they were alone.
Other studies confirm the same is true even when we're learning new activities.
Let's say someone is learning a new task—for example, learning how to type.
When they're conscious of being observed, they'll likely begin typing at a much faster rate than they would if they were alone.
But, and this is interesting, the study also showed that certain common behavior— things people typically do, like ...making mistakes when you're learning something new that behavior pattern will also increase.
So in other words, when we're learning to type, and we know we're being watched, we'll type faster but we'll also make more mistakes.

## Passage
People deal with each other every day. This interaction is at the heart of social life. The study of social interaction is concerned with the influence people have over one another’s behavior. People take each other into account in their daily behavior and in fact, the very presence of others can affect behavior. For example, one principle of social interaction, audience effects, suggests that individuals’ work is affected by their knowledge that they are visible to others, that the presence of others tends to alter the way people behave or perform an activity.

## Topic 
Explain how the examples of tying shoes and learning to type demonstrate the principle of audience effects.
