Personally, I disagree that studying math or science is more important than studying art or literature for two reason.

First off, expression is important. For example, I majored in computer science which has a lot of scientific paperwork and textbook to read, but however some of them are obscure due to many sentences having erroneous grammar. Literature, or rather expression, is still important when you want to introduce new concept to someone.

Secondly, art and literature can be a kind of entertainment. For instance, we don't usually see a person whose hobby is to resolve math problems. Although it's sometimes unnecessary to deeply study art or literature, it, on the other hand, may show a new perspective to have you appreciate those works much more.
