## Set 1 Topic 
Talk about a place you enjoyed going to or visiting when you were a child. Describe the place. Explain why you enjoyed it.

## Set 1 Response
Personally, the place that I enjoyed going to when I was a child is the park near my house.

First of all, it's hard to find a open place in the city to run around where is no traffic. It's the place safe for me to do many activities such as boating, swimming, and flying a kite.

Secondly, I made many friends in the park. Whenever I event, I could meet a lot of other kids who liked to spend time there. We would kick around a soccer ball and forget about school work. It was a very relaxing experience.

Since I had so much fun during the years, the parks remains one of my favorite places till today.

## Set 5 Listening
NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between two students.
MALE STUDENT: Susan! What happened to your arm?
FEMALE STUDENT: It's my *wrist*, actually-I *sprained* it last weekend.
And I'm kind of upset about it, because I'm *supposed to play the violin in my string quartet's big concert* next week.
We've been practicing for weeks.
And we've already sold a bunch of tickets.
MALE STUDENT: Oh, sorry to hear that. What are you gonna do?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, I was thinking about *trying to play anyhow.*
I mean, I really don't want to let the other three group members down.
Plus *the doctor said my wrist should be feeling better by then.*
MALE STUDENT: OK, so... problem solved, right?
FEMALE STUDENT:Not exactly—I'm *worried that I'm gonna be out of practice.*
Like, I haven't been able to play the violin since I sprained my wrist.
What if I don't play well?
I'd make the rest of the group sound bad.
MALE STUDENT: Why don'tcha *get somebody else to take your place?*
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, there's only one other person I know of who could do it, and that's *Jim*.
*He's a great violinist, and I'm sure he'd say yes*....
The thing is, he's *not very reliable.*
I mean, *I'm in the orchestra with him and he's always showing up late for rehearsals.*
MALE STUDENT: Oooh... so you're not sure you can depend on him.
FEMALE STUDENT: Exactly. And we have less than a week left to rehearse for the concert.
We'd really need him to show up on time for all our rehearsals.

## Set 5 Topic 
Briefly summarize the woman's problem. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation.

## Set 5 Response
The woman's problem is that she needs to play the violin in a big concert that many tickets have been sold, but she's hurt her arm, or rather wrist(手腕). There are two possible solutions: the first solution is to try to play anywhere, and the other solution is to get Jim to replace her and play in the concert. 

I think the first is better because that ways she won't let the other groups members down, and the doctor said her writs should be feeling better by then.

Also, she says that Jim is not reliable. If he's always late for the rehearsal, that'll compromise the whole performance. And that's unfair to the other group members who have been practicing for weeks.
