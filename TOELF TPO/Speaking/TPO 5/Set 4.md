## Content
The passage introduces the concept of target marketing, which is aimed to smaller and very specific audience who are determined to have the greatest desire for the product. The professor illustrates this idea with the example of two different commercials about the same telephone.

The first commercial is shown during the tv shows that young people watch. In the commercial, it emphasizes on how fun the phone is by something like bright colors of the phone and a good time with their friends.

On the other hand, another commercial is displayed during some business programs. It's designed to attract business people by showing how efficient the phone is and how it can handle their daily works easily.

NARRATOR: Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a marketing class.
MALE PROFESSOR: Nowadays, something you notice more and more is *television commercials that are made specifically for certain television programs.*
So let's say a company wants to sell a *telephone*, a cell phone.
Now *during TV shows that young people watch*, you know shows with pop music or teen serials, *they create the commercial that emphasizes how fun the phone is.*
You know, the phone has *bright colors* and they show kids having a *good time with their friends*.
And well the company wants the kids watching TV at this time to want to buy this phone, this phone that's made especially for them.
But the same company will make a *different commercial* to be shown during, say, a *program about business* or a business news show.
Now for this group of people, *business people*, the company will have to *show how efficient their phone is*, *how it can handle all business easily* and maybe even save money.
And here is the thing.
*It's basically the same phone.*
The company has just made *two different commercials to appeal to different groups of people.*

## Passage
Advertisers in the past have used radio and television in an attempt to provide information about their products to large, general audiences; it was once thought that the best way to sell a product was to advertise it to as many people as possible. However, more recent trends in advertising have turned toward target marketing. *Target marketing is the strategy of advertising to smaller, very specific audiences*â€” audiences that *have been determined to have the greatest need or desire for the product* being marketed. Target marketing has proved to be very effective in reaching potential customers.
