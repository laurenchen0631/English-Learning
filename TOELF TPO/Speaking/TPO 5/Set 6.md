## Notes
1. certain career, motivation, two types
2. extrinsic: obtain external rewarding, kid housework to obtain money
3. intrinsic: enjoy, accomplishment, pleasure, she go to gym several, more energy, more health last past 5 years

## Content
In the lecture, the professor talks about two types of motivation. She then gives two examples to illustrate these two types of motivation.

The first type is extrinsic motivation which base on obtaining external rewarding. For example, a child regularly do some housework because the kid will be given a small amount of money for the rewarding. However, if the money is no longer given, the child also stops doing the work.

The second type is called intrinsic motivation which depends on enjoy, accomplishment, or pleasure. Also, intrinsic motivation lasts longer than the extrinsic. Taking the professor's experience as instance, she used to go to gym several time a week because she felt more energetic and healthier rather than preparing a marathon or anything. And hence she kept this habit in the past five years.

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class.
FEMALE PROFESSOR: Why do we do the things we do?
What drives us to participate in certain activities, to buy a certain car or even to choose a certain career?
In other words, what motivates us to do what we do?
Well, in studies of motivation, psychologists distinguish between two very different types.
Our reasons for doing something, our motivations, can be *extrinsic*, in other words, *based on some kind of external reward like praise or money*.
Or they can be *intrinsic*, meaning we engage in the activity because *it pleases us internally.*
Both create strong forces that lead us to behave in certain ways.
However, *intrinsic motivation is generally considered to be more long-lasting* than the other.
As I said, extrinsic motivation is external.
It's the desire to behave in a certain way in order to *obtain some kind of external reward*.
*A child*, for example, who *regularly does small jobs around the house*, does them not because she enjoys taking out the garbage or doing the dishes but because she knows if she does these things; *she'll be given a small amount of money for doing them.*
But how motivated will the child be to continue doing the work *if her parents suddenly stop giving her money for it.*
With intrinsic or internal motivation, we want to do something because we *enjoy* it or get a sense of *accomplishment* from it.
Most people who are internally motivated get *pleasure* from the activity so they just feel good about doing it.
For example, *I go to the gym several times a week.*
I don't go because I'm training for a marathon or anything. I just enjoy it.
I have *more energy* after I exercise and I know it's *good for my health* so it makes me *feel good* about myself.
And that's what *kept me going there in the past five years*.
