## Reason
1. from multiple perspective (found more errors --> got better score)
2. know others better (become the intimate --> help each other even beside the assignments)

Personally, I believe that working on class assignments in a group is better than by themselves for two reasons.

To begin with, you can learn from multiple perspectives. For instance, I used to work alone before some classmate invited me into a study group. After that, I found more errors that I hadn't recognized before, and thus I got a better score in the college.

Secondly, it lets you know the others better. Taking the same study group as instance, I got acquainted with someone that I had no chance to realize before. And, after a while, we became the intimate that help and support each other even beside the assignments.

That's why I think that working with a group is a superior option.
