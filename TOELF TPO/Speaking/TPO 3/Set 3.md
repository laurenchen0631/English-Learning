According to the announcement, the university plans to have some changes on their dinning service. They intends to cancel the supply of hot breakfast because cold breakfast is healthier and it can save money to keep the meal plans affordable.

However, the woman opposes this change for two reason. First off, cold breakfast doesn't always mean health. For example, if it was a really cold morning, eating hot breakfast is better for students.

Secondly, she believes that students will pay more money to go off campus for something they want to eat because the choices in the dinning service are decreased. Even though the school save money to keep the meal plans, the students will still go off campus more often with expensive off-campus prices.

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.
FEMALE STUDENT: Do you believe any of this?
It's ridiculous.
MALE STUDENT: What do you mean?
Well it's important to eat healthy foods.
FEMALE STUDENT: Sure it is, but they are saying yogurt's better for you than an omelet…or than hot cereal?
I mean whether something is hot or cold, that shouldn't be the issue, except maybe on a really cold morning.
In that case which is going to be better for you—a bowl of cold cereal or a nice warm omelet?
It's obvious; there's no question.
MALE STUDENT: Uh I'm not gonna argue with you there.
FEMALE STUDENT: And this whole thing about saving money.
MALE STUDENT: What about it?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, they are actually going to make things worse for us, not better, 'cuz if they start cutting back and we can't get what we want right here on campus, well we are going to be going off campus and pay off-campus prices.
And you know what?
That'll be expensive.
Even if it's only two or three mornings a week, it can add up.

## Passage
Beginning next month, Dining Services will no longer serve hot breakfast foods at university dining halls. Instead, students will be offered a wide assortment of cold breakfast items in the morning. These cold breakfast foods, such as breads, fruit, and yogurt, are healthier than many of the hot breakfast items that we will stop serving, so health-conscious students should welcome this change. Students will benefit in another way as well, because limiting the breakfast selection to cold food items will save money and allow us to keep our meal plans affordable.
