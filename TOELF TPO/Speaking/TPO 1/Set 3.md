## Content
According to the letter, the university is planning to acquire a sculpture. However, the author of the letter oppose the plan because the university is in a poor financial condition and the sculpture will take up too much public space.

In the other hand, the woman disagrees with the opinions stated in the letter. First off, most of money is paid by a donor rather the university. Additionally, she thinks it's nice to have some art on campus.

Second, the woman says that Paul and his friends always play soccer at where the sculpture will be placed and hence they oppose the plan. She thinks that Paul disagree the plan since it is just inconvenient for him and his friends that they'll have to to find somewhere else to play.

## Talking
NARRATOR:  Now listen to two students discussing the opinion expressed in the letter.
MALE STUDENT:  Did you see Paul's letter in the paper about the new sculpture?
FEMALE STUDENT:  Yeah, but it was totally unconvincing.
His reasons for opposing the plan are just totally off.
I'm glad we'll finally have some nice art on campus.
I'd like to shake the donor's hand and say "Thank you!"
MALE STUDENT:  What do you mean "the donor?"
FEMALE STUDENT:  You didn't know? An anonymous donor is paying the bill for most of the sculpture.
MALE STUDENT:  Not the university?
FEMALE STUDENT:  No-his assumptions about who's paying for it are all wrong.
MALE STUDENT:  Still, I wonder if he has a point about the space it'll take up.
FEMALE STUDENT:  Well, you know why Paul is upset.
He and his friends are always out there on the lawn right where the sculpture will be, kicking around the soccer ball.
Now they'll just have to use another part of the campus to play.
MALE STUDENT:  Oh, so he just doesn't want to have to move?
FEMALE STUDENT:  Yeah! For him, it's sculpture versus convenience.

## Passage
The administration has plans to acquire a new sculpture for campus. We should all oppose this plan. The university’s poor financial condition led it to increase the price for campus housing and tuition by 15% this past year. Surely then it is no financial position to purchase such an expensive sculpture. Moreover, just look at the sculpture: several 60-foot long steel plates, jutting out of the earth at odd angles! It’s so large, it’ll take up all the green space in front of the campus center! This is public space that should be reserved for students to use.
