## Reason
1. use more sensational content to attract people than the past.
2. as a entertainment, it is not healthy.

## Content
Personally, I agree with that television has had a negative influence on society for two reasons.

The first reason is that it is not healthy. For example, many people now watch television as a holiday's entertainment. If they don't regulate the time spent on it, people will sit on their sofa and watch it for all day long. It cause some serious healthy problems, such myopia and obesity.

Although television was a good tool to announce information or emergent situation for people, in recent, many television programs are produced to boost the number of watching. Modern tv shows usually use sensational material, such as violence and gunfire to lure more and more people by showing those bloody scenes that have negative impact, especially, on children.
