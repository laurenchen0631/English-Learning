Out of all books that I have ever read, I'd pick Harry Potter as a important book to me. I feel that for two reasons. 

First of all, it led me to the world of novels. For instance, when I was a child, I some kind of hated reading books, because those books in school, textbooks, were too boring to read. However, exciting story of Harry Potter made me fall in love with books.

Another reason is that it concretely shape a world containing magics in my, and many people's, mind. Basically, when it comes to magics, wizards or witches, the first thing come to my mind is definitely Harry Potter. When I am thinking some fantasy adventure *plot*, this book is always my top choice to refer to.

That's why Harry Potter was important to me.
