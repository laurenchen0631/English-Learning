## Response
According to the newspaper, the university plans to offer a new computer class *in the evening* because daytime class is too overcrowded *and adding classes is most cost-effective way*. However, the student doesn't support this *decision* for 2 reasons.

The first point he makes is that the students are busy *at night*. They have a lot of activities to do at the night, such as job and club. There is not possible for many students to attend the class in the evening.

A second reason is that it is more expensive to hire more teachers *and extend open time of the building* than *to buy* more computers. That's because that the space in the classroom is enough to hold new computers and also that the computers are getting cheaper and cheaper in the recent years.

## Vocab

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to two students discussing the article.
MALE STUDENT: I just don't think this will work.
FEMALE STUDENT: Why not?
MALE STUDENT: Because it's not gonna solve the problem.
*Students are busy at night.*
I mean, we have *jobs, families, clubs, social events*... Most of us already have something to do every single night of the week.
FEMALE STUDENT: I see your point.
I sure couldn't fit anything into my schedule during the week.
I've got swimming practice most nights.
MALE STUDENT: Right, and as far as expense goes, I think they are going about it the wrong way.
I mean, *it cost money to hire more teachers and keep the academic building open later*, which is a lot *more expensive than just simply buying more computers*.
FEMALE STUDENT: More computers?
MALE STUDENT: That's right.
*Computer prices have come way down the past few years.*
So the department won't have to spend as much now as they did in the past.
Besides, *the computer department classrooms*, you know, the rooms themselves, they are actually *very big*.
There's plenty of space to add more computers.

## Passage
The computer department is considering *offering evening classes* in the fall. The proposal to add the classes is a response to student complaints that *daytime computer classes have become increasingly overcrowded* and there are no longer enough computers available. The department has decided that despite some added expense, the *most cost-effective way* of addressing this problem is by adding computer classes in the evening. It is hoped that this change will decrease the number of students enrolled in day classes and thus guarantee individual access to computers for all students in computer classes.
