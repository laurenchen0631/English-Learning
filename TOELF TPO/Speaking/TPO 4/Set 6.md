## Content
In the lecture, the professor talks about the importance of visual elements in the paintings. She then gives two examples to illustrate the idea.

The first example the professor gives is color. Color can convey different meanings, such as red which can express strong emotions like joy or angry. On the other hand, cool colors like blue have a calming effect on viewers.

Another example is texture. When using rough texture, artists can evoke strong emotions and strength, while a smooth texture seems less emotional.

Finally, the professor goes on to say that different visual components can work together. For example, a wide, rough brush stroke combined with red or orange creates chaotic and wild feeling . While a tiny, smooth brush stroke with soft color express peaceful emotions.

## Vocab

## Talking
NARRATOR: Listen to part of a talk in art appreciation class.
FEMALE PROFESSOR: In order for art to communicate—to *appeal to the emotions* or the intellect—it has to combine various *visual elements to express meaning*… or emotion.
It's really the visual components of the work—things like *color, texture, shape…lines*—and how these elements work together, that tell us something about the work.
Artists combine and manipulate these visual elements to express a message or to create a mood.
Think about how a painter might *use color, for example.*
You all know from experience that different colors appeal in different ways to the senses and ca*n convey different meanings.*
An artist chooses certain colors to evoke a particular mood and make powerful statements.
The color *red, for example, is a strong color and can conjure up strong emotions*, such as extreme *joy or excitement or even anger*.
*Blue*, on the other hand, is considered *a cool color*.
Blue colors tend to have a *calming effect on viewers*.
Another visual element important to art is texture.
By texture, I mean the surface quality or feel of the work - its *smoothness or roughness* or softness.
Now, of course, in some types of art, the texture's physical - it can actually be touched by the fingers.
But *in painting, for example, texture can be visual.*
The way an artist paints certain areas of the painting can create the illusion of texture, an object's smoothness or roughness or softness.
A *rough texture can evoke stronger emotions and strength*, while a *smooth texture is more calming and less emotional*.
As I said earlier, *artists often combine elements* to convey a message about the work.
Take a painting that, say, uses a lot of strong colors like *reds and oranges and uses brush strokes that are broad -wide*, sweeping brush strokes that suggest a *rough texture.*
Well, these elements together can *convey a wilder, more chaotic emotion* in the viewer than, more than, say, a *painting with tiny, smooth brush strokes and soft or pale colors.*
Artists use these visual effects and the senses they arouse to give meaning to their work.
