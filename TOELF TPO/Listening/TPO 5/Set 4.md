NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.

FEMALE STUDENT: Hi, I was wondering if I could talk with you about the assignment in the film theory class.

MALE PROFESSOR: Of course, Jill.

FEMALE STUDENT: It seems that pretty much everyone else in the class gets what they are supposed to be doing but I'm not so sure.

MALE PROFESSOR: Well, the class is for students who are really serious about film.You must have taken film courses before.

FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, in high school, [upspeak] Film Appreciation.

MALE PROFESSOR: Um... I wouldn't think that would be enough. Did you concentrate mainly on form or content?

FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, definitely content. We'd watch, say Lord of the Flies, and then discuss it.

MALE PROFESSOR: Oh, that approach…treating film as literature, ignoring what makes it unique.

FEMALE STUDENT: I liked it, though.

MALE PROFESSOR: Sure, but that kind of class…Well, I'm not surprised that you are feeling a little lost.You know, we have two introductory courses that are supposed to be taken before you get to my course—one in film art, techniques…technical stuff…and another in film history.So students in the class you are in should be pretty far along in film studies.In fact, usually the system blocks anyone trying to sign up for a class they shouldn’t be taking, who hasn’t taken the courses you’re required to do first, as prerequisites.

FEMALE STUDENT: Well, I did have a problem with that but I discussed it with one of your office staff, and she gave me permission.

MALE PROFESSOR: Of course. [no surprise] No matter how many times I tell them, they just keep on.Well, for your own good, I'd really suggest dropping back and starting at the usual place.

FEMALE STUDENT: Yes. But I've already been in this class for 4 weeks.I'd hate to just drop it now especially since I find it so different, so interesting.

MALE PROFESSOR: I guess so—frankly, I can't believe you've lasted this long.These are pretty in-depth theories we've been discussing and you've been doing OK so far, I guess.But still, the program's been designed to progress through certain stages.Like any other professional training we build on previous knowledge.

FEMALE STUDENT: Then maybe you could recommend some extra reading I can do to catch up?

MALE PROFESSOR: Well, are you intending to study film as your main concentration?

FEMALE STUDENT: No, no, I—I am just interested. I'm actually in marketing, but there seems to be a connection.

MALE PROFESSOR: Oh... well, in... in that case, if you're taking the course just out of interest, I mean I still highly recommend signing up for the introductory courses at some point, but in the meantime, there is no harm I guess in trying to keep up with this class.The interest is clearly there.Uh, instead of any extra reading just now though, you could view some of the old introductory lectures—we have them on video—that would give you a better handle on the subject.It's still a pretty tall order, and we will be moving right along, so you will really need to stay on top of it.

FEMALE STUDENT: OK, I've been warned. Now, could I tell you about my idea for the assignment...?
