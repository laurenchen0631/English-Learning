NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between a student and a *receptionist* at the *Registrar's Office* **on the first day of the semester**.

FEMALE STUDENT: Excuse me, I'm supposed to be having my physics class in the science building, but no one's in the classroom. Could you tell me where the class is? Physics 403 - has it been moved?

MALE RECEPTIONIST: Well, there's a *room assignment sheet* on the *bulletin board* outside this office, …[trails off]

FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, I know, but my class isn't listed there. There must be some kinda mistake or something. Could you look it up, please?

MALE RECEPTIONIST: Hmmm... ok, let me check on the computer. It's physics, right? Wait, did you say Physics 403?

FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah.

MALE RECEPTIONIST: Er... I'm sorry, but it says here that it was cancelled. You should have gotten a letter from the registrar's office about this.

FEMALE STUDENT: What? I've never got it.

MALE RECEPTIONIST: Are you sure? Cuz it says on the computer that the letter was sent out to students a week ago.

FEMALE STUDENT: Really? I should have gotten it by now. I wonder if I threw it away with all the junk mail by mistake.

MALE RECEPTIONIST: Well, it does happen.... Er... let me check something. What's your name?

FEMALE STUDENT: Woodhouse, Laura Woodhouse.

MALE RECEPTIONIST: Ok, hmmm... Woodhouse, let me see... ah, it says here we sent it to your apartment on er... Center Street.

FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, that's my old apartment. I moved out of there a little while ago… .

MALE RECEPTIONIST: Well, and I suppose you haven't changed your mailing address at the *administration office*. Well, that would explain it.

FEMALE STUDENT: [sigh] Yeah, I guess that's it. But *how can they cancel the class after offering it*? **If I'd known this was gonna happen, I would have taken it last semester.**

MALE RECEPTIONIST: I know, it's really inconvenient for you, I understand that, but un… if we don't have enough students signed up for the course, the college can't offer it, you know, it's um, a *practical* issue, like, we can't have an *instructor* when there’re only a few students in the class. You see what I mean?

FEMALE STUDENT: I guess, but now I don't know what course I should take instead.

MALE RECEPTIONIST: Ok, let's see. *Do you have any courses you're gonna take next semester? If you do, you might want to take them now and sign up for physics 403 next semester.*

FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, I guess I could do that. I just hope it won't be cancelled again.Do you know how many people have to be enrolled in order to keep a class from being cancelled?

MALE RECEPTIONIST: Well, it depends on the class, but for that class, you have to have er... let's see, usually it'd be at least ten people, but *since it was cancelled this semester, they might even do it with less*. But do you know what you should do? Give the physics department a call a couple of weeks before the semester starts. *They'll be able to tell you if they're planning to go through with it.* It's their decision, actually.

FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, ok, I will do that. Thanks for the info.

MALE RECEPTIONIST: No problem. Sorry about the class… Oh, why don't you go change your mailing address now. It'll only take a minute.

FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, oh, sure, I will do that right away.
