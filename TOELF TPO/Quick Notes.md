## Tips
1. Listen for key concepts, don’t transcribe. 
	* Writing down everything the teacher says will waste time
	* **Pick up on larger, overarching issues**. You should be writing out short sentences, no more than five words.
1. Use shorthand. Figure out a personal shorthand that works best for you. Here are some ways you can try shorthand
	* Use abbreviations for both proper nouns and long and tedious words. For example, write “US” for “United States,” but also "w" for "with," "b/w" for between, "ex" for "example(s)."
	* Drop articles like “the,” “an,” and “a.”
	* Drop vowels. For example, write “trnsfrmtn” instead of “transformation.”
	* Use arrows and lines to convey relationships. For example, instead of saying “the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand IN 1914 caused World War I,” say, “ass. F Ferdinand → ww1 - 1914”
	* Write in cursive (草寫). Like the gel pen, writing in cursive will shave off note-taking time because your pen never leaves the paper.
