## Tips
1. Make the Most Of Your Scratch Paper
	* One reason is so you don’t have to constantly flip to a new page or turn a page over to continue your notes.
	* Asking a staff member for additional scratch paper can waste valuable test time.
	* **Begin your TOEFL notes in the top-left corner** of each page and working your way down as you fill up space.
1. Write Neatly and Clearly
	* The best way to organize notes is to *write down question numbers*.
	* For lists, use either bullet points or numbers to keep track of steps in a process
	* If there are multiple speakers or sources of information, **try drawing a chart with two columns**. These columns can be used to summarize what different speakers say or what different resources talk about.
1. Write Down Only the Most Important Ideas
	* Writing down everything the teacher says will waste time. If you're having a difficult time listening to the conversation because you are taking notes, then you probably need to take fewer notes.
	* **Pick up on larger, overarching issues**. You should be writing out short sentences, no more than five words.
	* In TOEFL, a particular term or concept will usually be accompanied by an image of the word or phrase written out on a blackboard. In these cases, always take care to write down the term or concept in your notes. And don’t forget to note its definition, too
	* Take care to write down the following pieces of information in your notes:
		1. The **topic** of the conversation or lecture
		1. **Key points, reasons, and examples**
		1. Important **terminology** and phrases
		1. **Different speakers’ opinions**, questions, and reactions
		1. **Any solutions or suggestions**
		1. **Any decisions made**
1. Use shorthand. Figure out a personal shorthand that works best for you. Here are some ways you can try shorthand
	* Use abbreviations for both proper nouns and long and tedious words. For example, write “US” for “United States,” but also "w" for "with," "b/w" for between, "ex" for "example(s)."
	* Drop articles like “the,” “an,” and “a.”
	* Drop vowels. For example, write “trnsfrmtn” instead of “transformation.”
	* Use arrows and lines to convey relationships. For example, instead of saying “the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand IN 1914 caused World War I,” say, “ass. F Ferdinand → ww1 - 1914”
	* Write in cursive (草寫). Like the gel pen, writing in cursive will shave off note-taking time because your pen never leaves the paper.
1. Practice Your TOEFL Note-Taking Skills
	* The only way to become a better, faster, and more accurate is to practice, practice, practice.
1. Write as You Listen
	* Our first and most important is to always write as you listen to the audio clips.
	* Taking notes after the audio clip finishes means that you’ll end up taking your notes during the time you’re given to answer questions
	* **Aim to jot down notes throughout the entire audio clip**. Though difficult, taking notes as you listen helps you recall all of the main points you’ll likely be asked about later.
	* Remember, you don’t need to write down every detail mentioned in the audio clip — just the main topic, the key points, and any examples.
1. Pinpoint the Main Idea Right Away
	* **As soon as the audio clip begins playing, try to recognize what the overarching topic is**.
	* Predict what the rest of the audio clip is likely to focus on and what types of details you may hear
	* You should be able to catch the main idea of the conversation or lecture **within the first few sentences**.
	* For example, in one sample lecture transcript, the narrator states, “Listen to part of a lecture in a *literature* class.” **Right away, we know that the topic is literature.** The professor then begins his lecture: “Today I’d like to introduce you to a *novel* that some critics consider the* finest detective novel* ever written. It was also the first. We’re talking about *The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins*.” We can therefore predict that the bulk of this lecture will likely revolve around who wrote the novel, what its plot is, and why it’s a significant piece of work.
1. Figure Out the Style of Organization
	* According to ETS, there are four main organizational styles of lectures:
		1. **Theory and evidence**: The professor introduces a theory and provides various pieces of evidence to support it.
		1. **Cause and effect**: This type of lecture focuses on the cause of something (such as an event, discovery, or scientific phenomenon) and its different effects.
		1. **Steps of a process**: In this style, the professor introduces a process and the chronological steps involved in it (usually using transitions such as “first,” “second,” “third,” etc.).
		1. **Comparison of two things**: A lecture that focuses on two different concepts’ similarities and differences.
	* Each of these styles can be understood fairly **early on in an audio clip by listening for key words, phrases**, and descriptions given by the professor.
	* For example, "... This increase in literacy, in reading, *led to* an increase in demand for eyeglasses. And here’s something you probably ... " Notice that the professor uses the phrase “led to” to describe how the increase in literacy has affected the demand for eyeglasses. Therefore, this lecture will most likely be a cause and effect lecture.
1. Keep Track Of Who Says What
	* It’s critical you keep track of who says what — in particular, who holds which opinions, who poses which questions, and who makes which points.
	* Consider organizing your notes so that you have a column for Speaker A and a column for Speaker B.
1. Keep moving
	* Practically speaking, your mind may wander or at some points, you may not understand what the professor is talking about. **When this happens, just let it go and start listening again.**
	* If you try to figure out or stress about what you missed, you will end up missing even more or you will become completely lost. It's better to potentially miss one point rather than missing several.
	* Another issue is if you end up missing several, you may become extremely stressed out, which can carry over to other sections of speaking and writing.
1. Listen for Transitional Words and Phrases
	* While you **don’t need to record these transitions** in your notes, listening for them will allow you to identify when a new point or example is being introduced.
	* When you hear ordered transitions, such as **“first,” “second,” and “next,”** note a separate thought by **bullet pointing or numbering a new line**. 
	* With **contrastive transitions (e.g., “but,” “however,” etc.)**, make a note that the upcoming point will contrast with what was just said, perhaps by **marking the old thought with an “X” or other symbol**.
