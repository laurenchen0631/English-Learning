# Integrated Essay
* First, students read an article (four paragraphs) about an academic topic. Next, they listen to a lecture which opposes the main argument of the article. 
* You may only listen to the lecture once, but you can look at the article while you are writing your essay.
* Finally, they must write an essay of about 280-300 words about the relationship between the article and the lecture.
* Styles of Questions
	1. Opposition Style
		* The reading makes a claim about a specific topic. It includes three supporting reasons. 
		* The lecture challenges this claim
	1. Problems and Solutions Style
		* The reading mentions three problems related to some topic or theory
		* The lecturer provides solutions to these three problems.  
	1. Solutions and Problems Style
		* The reading suggests three solutions to a problem.  
		* The lecturer describes how these solutions are not effective.
* Structure of the Article and Lecture
	* The article begins with an introductory paragraph where the main topic is mentioned.  
	* The introduction of the article is followed by three body paragraphs.  Each body paragraph contains one supporting argument, one problem or solution.
	* At the beginning of the lecture, you will hear the lecturer's main idea. Here he states the opposite of the reading's main argument, or says that there are solutions to the problems, or states that the given solutions are faulty. 
	* The rest of the lecture will consist of their three opposing arguments, three solutions, or three problems. It is important to note that these counter-points directly challenge the three 
* Tips:
	1. Remember that **the lecture will always oppose the article.**
	1. Your job is to describe how the lecture opposes the article.
	1. **You should take notes while listening to the lecture.** It is important to note that these counter-points directly challenge the three arguments/problems/solutions mentioned in the reading. Not only that, but they are in the same order. 
	1. These 3 question styles are all quite similar, so **you will write the same kind of essay no matter what style the question takes**. 
	1. The **lecture summary is the most important part** of the essay. That should make up about 60% of each body paragraph.
	1. Avoid copying from the reading word for word. Paraphrase as much as you can.

	* Sample: 
		**The reading and the lecture are both about** the collapse of the civilization on Easter Island. **The author of the reading feels that** there are three possible explanations for the collapse. **The lecturer challenges the claims made by the author**. **He is of the opinion that** these explanations are faulty.

		**To begin with, the author argues that** the collapse might have been caused by rats that ate the seeds of palm trees. **The article mentions that** this caused erosion and soil loss, which made it hard to grow food. **This specific argument is challenged by the lecturer**. **He claims** that even if deforestation occurred the people on the island would have had enough food. **Additionally, he says** that 60% of their diet came from the sea, and they also used rock gardens to grow potatoes in weak soil.

		**Secondly, the writer suggests** that the collapse may have been caused by warfare. **In the article, it is said that** many curved blades used as weapons have been found on Easter Island. **The lecturer, however, rebuts this by mentioning** that the shapes of the blades suggest that they were not actually weapons. **He elaborates on this by bringing up the point that** they are neither sharp nor pointy, so they were probably just used as tools for cutting stone.

		**Finally, the author posits that** the society on the island could have been destroyed by exposure to diseases brought by foreign visitors. **Moreover, in the article it is stated that** thousands died as a result of this. **In contrast, the lecturer's position is** that when contact with Europeans and South Americans began the population of the island was only about 3000. **He notes that** since the population was twenty thousand before contact, whatever caused the decline must have started long before then.
