* First, students read an article (four paragraphs) about an academic topic. Next, they listen to a lecture which opposes the main argument of the article. 
* You may only listen to the lecture once, but you can look at the article while you are writing your essay.
* Finally, they must write an essay of about 280-300 words about the relationship between the article and the lecture.
* Styles of Questions
	1. Opposition Style
		* The reading makes a claim about a specific topic. It includes three supporting reasons. 
		* The lecture challenges this claim
	1. Problems and Solutions Style
		* The reading mentions three problems related to some topic or theory
		* The lecturer provides solutions to these three problems.  
	1. Solutions and Problems Style
		* The reading suggests three solutions to a problem.  
		* The lecturer describes how these solutions are not effective.
* Structure of the Article and Lecture
	* The article begins with an introductory paragraph where the main topic is mentioned.  
	* The introduction of the article is followed by three body paragraphs.  Each body paragraph contains one supporting argument, one problem or solution.
	* At the beginning of the lecture, you will hear the lecturer's main idea. Here he states the opposite of the reading's main argument, or says that there are solutions to the problems, or states that the given solutions are faulty. 
	* The rest of the lecture will consist of their three opposing arguments, three solutions, or three problems. It is important to note that these counter-points directly challenge the three 
* Tips:
	1. Remember that **the lecture will always oppose the article.**
	1. Your job is to describe how the lecture opposes the article.
	1. **You should take notes while listening to the lecture.** It is important to note that these counter-points directly challenge the three arguments/problems/solutions mentioned in the reading. Not only that, but they are in the same order. 
	1. These 3 question styles are all quite similar, so **you will write the same kind of essay no matter what style the question takes**. 
	1. The **lecture summary is the most important part** of the essay. That should make up about 60% of each body paragraph.
	1. Avoid copying from the reading word for word. Paraphrase as much as you can.
* Template:
	* Introduction:
		* The reading and the lecture are both about _____.
		* The author of the reading feels that ______.
		* The lecturer challenges the claims made by the author.
		* He is of the opinion that _____.
	* The Body Paragraphs:
		* To begin with, the author argues that _____.

		* Finally, the author posits that _____.
		* Moreover, it is stated in the article that ____.
		* In contrast, the lecturer's position is  _____.
		* He notes that _____.
	* Sample: 
		**The reading and the lecture are both about** the collapse of the civilization on Easter Island. **The author of the reading feels that** there are three possible explanations for the collapse. **The lecturer challenges the claims made by the author**. **He is of the opinion that** these explanations are faulty.

		**To begin with, the author argues that** the collapse might have been caused by rats that ate the seeds of palm trees. **The article mentions that** this caused erosion and soil loss, which made it hard to grow food. **This specific argument is challenged by the lecturer**. **He claims** that even if deforestation occurred the people on the island would have had enough food. **Additionally, he says** that 60% of their diet came from the sea, and they also used rock gardens to grow potatoes in weak soil.

		**Secondly, the writer suggests** that the collapse may have been caused by warfare. **In the article, it is said that** many curved blades used as weapons have been found on Easter Island. **The lecturer, however, rebuts this by mentioning** that the shapes of the blades suggest that they were not actually weapons. **He elaborates on this by bringing up the point that** they are neither sharp nor pointy, so they were probably just used as tools for cutting stone.

		**Finally, the author posits that** the society on the island could have been destroyed by exposure to diseases brought by foreign visitors. **Moreover, in the article it is stated that** thousands died as a result of this. **In contrast, the lecturer's position is** that when contact with Europeans and South Americans began the population of the island was only about 3000. **He notes that** since the population was twenty thousand before contact, whatever caused the decline must have started long before then.

* Examples:
	1. 
	There are many great gifts that can be given to a child. I believe that the best gift to give a child is a pet.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.  First, a pet can be very educational.  Second, a pet can be a good friend to a young child. 

	To begin with, a pet is a very educational gift.  Having a pet teaches children responsibility.  A pet has to be fed every day and be given a chance to exercise.  The owner of a pet also has to observe the health of their pet and take action if it becomes sick.  Practicing this kind of responsibility will make a child more mature.  Moreover, a pet can help teach a child about the stages of life.  Animals grow much faster than humans and a young child can learn a lot by observing how their pet grows up.  I had a pet gecko as a child and watching it grow from a baby to a full-sized adult taught me a lot and got me very interested in biology and nature.

	Secondly, I feel that a pet makes great friend.   It is good for children to have pets because they are never judgmental.  A child might have a bad day at school or he might get in a fight with his friends, but he will never fight with his pet.  It will love him unconditionally.  Furthermore, pets can prevent children from being lonely.  These days parents are often too busy to spend time with their children.  They often leave their kids home alone.  This might leave some kids feeling lonely, but those with pets will never feel alone.

	To sum it up, I feel that a pet is the very best gift to give to a child. This is because pets are very educational, and they make great friends. There really is no better gift that a child can receive than a pet.

	2. 
	There are many different learning styles, and it is important that we look for classes that match our academic preferences. **Personally, I believe that** it is extremely beneficial to take classes which are very interactive. **I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay**.

	**First of all,** classes that include a lot of discussions develop our communication skills. Our long-term success depends on our ability to persuade others to accept our ideas and proposals, so it critically important to seize opportunities to talk to a variety of people. If we do not practice this skill, we will never develop it. **My personal experience is a compelling example of this.** About ten years ago, I enrolled in a history class. At that time I had already taken many classes at university, but I was still very shy around strangers. However, after nine months of participating in debates, discussions and presentations in that class I came out of my shell and became a very confident public speaker. As a result, when I began my career following my graduation I excelled in group work and was seen by my supervisors as a natural leader. For this reason, I was quickly promoted within my company. I have been very successful at my workplace, and I owe it all to that wonderful class.

	**Secondly,** classes that are very interactive help us to form connections with our classmates, and these can lead to future opportunities.  When we regularly converse with our peers, we get to know their personalities. **Consequently**, we can even become very close friends with them. In contrast, when students just sit and passively listen to their professor, they are unlikely to get to know each other. **For instance,** when my brother was in college he took an information technology class that required a lot of group work. He spent two months that semester working on a programming project with two other students and during that time they all became very close. In fact, a year later they felt comfortable enough to actually form a company together. It has been six years since they founded that business and it is still very profitable.

	**In conclusion**, **I am of the opinion that** it is a great idea to take classes where students actually talk to each other and their professor. **This is because** they help us develop valuable skills and abilities, **and** because they help us form important social connections.


* Tips
	1. Do not use memorized examples. Make sure to use your own words.

	1. Try to **use transitional phrases** in between your details (“moreover,” “furthermore,” “also”). Don’t start sentences with coordinating conjunctions (FANBOYS).
	1. **Emphasize the example**. It is the easiest part to write, so make it about 60% (or more) of each body paragraph
	1. Don’t introduce new ideas in the conclusion
	1. Don’t write “This is because that…”
	1. Aim for about 380 to 400 words. Write a bit more if need a really high score

	1. 
	It appears, in so many aspects, very difficult to prefer one to another because all of them have their advantages and disadvantages to the extent that it is hard to distinguish.

	Then why do I prefer A? I like it because it can _______________, thus makes me ______________.

	Yet another reason is that_________. I can quote a common example. _______________.
	Then why I do not like others? For example, why I do not like A? Because I have a bad experience with it. _______________. So, even when anyone mentioned it, I would catch a feeling of fear.
	There are still many other reasons that can account for my fondness for it, but the obvious ones have been presented as above.

* 問題分析型: …XXX…What do you think about it?

	1. 
	There are numerous approaches to [solving XXX / impacts on XXX / characteristics of XXX], and I would explore the most conspicuous ones here.
	[One of the primary method / One of the primary impacts / One of the primary characteristics], **to my mind**, is that ______.
	A more subtle point which we must consider is that________.
	[**In addition / Furthermore**], ______.

	**The first is that**_______.
	The second is that______.
	Third, _______.
	**Generally**, people who attack AAA **claim that** _______. They also often say that there will be problems of ________.
	**As far as I am concerned, I come to the notion that** there are three main reasons why I support AAA. Firstly, _______. Secondly, ______. Furthermore, _______. 

* Preference 1: Some people like A; others like B. Which one do you prefer—A or B?
	1. 
	No doubt, I choose A, because there are too many benefits that outnumber its disadvantages. But B, on the other hand, has advantages no more than its disadvantages.
	**The most important benefit of A is** that______.
	To achieve the same effect, B will_______.
	Another benefit of A, which B almost cannot achieve, is that________.
	**Although B also has its seemingly profound advantages**, it can only be achieved conditionally because_______.

	2. 
	A and B are two totally different ideas that have caused a heated debate for a long period. Anyway, I agree with the idea of A. **However, it is unfair to say which is better than the other if we do not see both sides of the story in the following paragraphs.**
	Some people believe B because______. **These people point out the fact that**______. **They also argue that**_________.
	However, other people **stand on a very different ground**, they believe that_______. They firmly point out that_______. **An example can give the details of** this argument: ________. In addition, __________.
	In a word, A is too temptating not to be chosen. A, **as shown above**, has________.
