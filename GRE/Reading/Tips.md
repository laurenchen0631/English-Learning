## Short Passage
- Ingredients:
	1. Old Theory or explanation is **challenged by a new one** (usually in science passage)
	2. **Debate** on an issue (usually in social passage).
	3. In literary-themed passages, the author will **present the opinion**.
- Structure
	- Note **pivot words**(however/yet) and **pivot phrases** ("A **new** theory has emerged"; "Chesowitz **disagrees** with this line or reasoning"; "**recently** scientists have found")
	- **First sentence will introduce topic** or controversy/debate/mystery
	- **Second focus on new angle/theory/explanation to mystery**
	- Supporting details
		- During the first reading, don't feel you have to absorb every detail.
		- However, **understanding these evidences is key**
		- **Return to the evidence once dealing with a specific question**

## Five Steps Methods
1. Read Question
2. Ignore Answers
3. Paraphrase question (if need be)
4. Hunt in the passage to find supporting text
	- Use words that show up in the question
	- Use line reference
5. Answer question in your own words (using supporting text)

## Answer Trap
- Use words in the passage but twist the meaning
- True, but in a different part of the passage
- True/commonsensical in the real world, but not found in the passage.
- Everything is right except for that ony fishy thing (rotten spot)
- Others
	- Too general/vague
	- Too specific
	- Mentions something that isn't in the passage

## Primary Purpose
- Primary purpose usually consists of first sentence of the passage and the last sentence.
- Write primary in your tongue, not having the answers mislead your thinking.  

## Inference Question
- Common keys:
	- the author **implies** that ...
	- It can be **inferred** from the passage ....
	- The passage **most supports** ...
	- The author would **most likely** ...
	- What position would the author **probably** take regarding ...
- Inference on the GRE have a very close connection to what's actually stated in the passage.
- Wrong answers
	- **A paraphrase or a stated fact** is not a valid inference.
	- Common sense or outside knowledge, which is not included in the passage, is not a valid inference.

## Detail Question
- May give you a specific line reference or a specific word(s).
- Strategies
	1. Read entire answer choice
	2. Backup with information in the passage
	3. Put in your own words.

## The Vocab-in-context Question
- Treat like a Text Completion
	- Come up with your own word
- **Resist the urge to plug answer choices back into the paragraph.**
- Answer must always be a dictionary definition of the word. 

## Select the Sentence Question
- Require you to understand the structure.
- Most of times there are only two sentences that could be the answer.
- Be careful to distinguish the sentence that mentions the topic from the sentence that actually answers the questions. (Read the question.)

## Multiple-Answer Question
- Any one of the three questions can be correct
- The answers tend to be less obviously wrong than the answers in other type of questions.
- General strategy is the same: base your answer on evidence in passage or skip it.

## Structure Question
- Example: Which of the following best describes the primary function of the third sentence?
- Approach
	1. Read the referenced sentence and then describe it in your own words.
	2. Read the sentence before the referenced one and then describe the function of the referenced one.

## Paragraph Argument
- Elements
	- Premise: facts
	- Conclusion: Tying together of facts
- The Gap: something that the conclusion does not take into account.
	- B --> X rather than A --> X 
- Weakening/Strengthening the Argument
	- Identify premises
	- Spot the conclusion
	- Think of unstated assumption
	- Go through every answer choice, not spending too much time on any one answer.
	- Make sure your answer directly attack the assumption.
	- Assumption
		- Use Negating assumption technique
		- If the assumption is not valid, hen the conclusion completely falls apart.
		- If this negated answer choice is true, the argument will fall apart.
	- Common wrong choices
		1. Irrelevant, ungrounded analogy
		2. Opposite
		3. **Seems to do something**
- Paradox Argument
	- Two premises and no conclusion
	- Find an answer that resolves the discrepancy.
- Boldfaced Argument
	- The hardest paragraph argument question.
	- Example: In the argument above, the bold-faced parts play which of the following roles.
	- Strategy:
		1. **Read entire paragraph**
		2. Use your own words to describe the function of a boldface part.
		3. **Do one boldfaced at a time.**
		4. Watch out for multiple positions on an issue. 
		5. **Don't get lost in the verbiage of the answer choice.**
		6. If you can confidently eliminate one part of an answer choice, do not read the second part.
- Number vs Percent
	- Percentage != Actual numbers

## Strategy
- Do not forget the conclusion. Avoid the verbiage.
	- Refer back to the conclusion if 
		1. you are unsure about an answer choice
		2. you want to check your answer
