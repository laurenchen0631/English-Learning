## Short Passage
- Ingredients:
	1. Old Theory or explanation is **challenged by a new one** (usually in science passage)
	2. **Debate** on an issue (usually in social passage).
	3. In literary-themed passages, the author will **present the opinion**.
- Structure
	- Note **pivot words**(however/yet) and **pivot phrases** ("A **new** theory has emerged"; "Chesowitz **disagrees** with this line or reasoning"; "**recently** scientists have found")
	- **First sentence will introduce topic** or controversy/debate/mystery
	- **Second focus on new angle/theory/explanation to mystery**
	- Supporting details
		- During the first reading, don't feel you have to absorb every detail.
		- However, **understanding these evidences is key**
		- **Return to the evidence once dealing with a specific question**

## Five Steps Methods
1. Read Question
2. Ignore Answers
3. Paraphrase question (if need be)
4. Hunt in the passage to find supporting text
	- Use words that show up in the question
	- Use line reference
5. Answer question in your own words (using supporting text)

## Answer Trap
- Use words in the passage but twist the meaning
- True, but in a different part of the passage
- True/commonsensical in the real world, but not found in the passage.
- Everything is right except for that ony fishy thing (rotten spot)
