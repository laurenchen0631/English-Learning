While chocolate was highly esteemed in Mesoamerican where it originated, its adoption in Europe was initially slow. There is a common belief that Europeans needed to "transform" chocolate to make it appetizing. However, while Spaniards did put sugar, which was unknown to indigenous Americans, into chocolate beverages, this additive was not completely innovative. Mesoamericans were already *sweetening* chocolate with honey, and the step from honey to sugar -- increasingly more available than honey because of expanding sugar plantations in the Americans -- is a small one. Likewise, although Spaniards adjusted Mesoamerican recipes by using European spices, the spices chosen suggest an attempt to replicate harder-to-find native flowers. There is no indication the Spaniards deliberately tried to change the original flavor of chocolate.

1. The author of the passage refers to the use of honey primarily to
	1. identify the origins of an additive previously untried by Europeans
	1. present an example of a product that was unknown to Europeans
	1. correct the misapprehension that Mesoamericans used a sweetener that was not available in Europe
	1. provide an example of an ingredient that was in the process of being displaced by a substitute
	1. explain why the Spanish use of sugar in chocolate was not a sign of a need to transform chocolate

2. Select the sentence that presents a misconception that the passage challenges.

The decrease in responsiveness that follows continuous stimulation (adaptation) is common to all sensory system, including olfaction. With continued exposure to *chronically present ambient odors*, individuals' perception of odor intensity is greatly reduced. Moreover, these perceptual changes can be profound and durable. It is commonly reported that following extended absences from the odorous environment, *reexposure* may still fail to *elicit* perception at the original intensity. 

Most **research on olfactory adaptation** examines relatively transient changes in stimulus detection or perceived intensity-rarely exceeding several hours and often less-but because olfactory adaptation can be produced with relatively short exposures, these durations are sufficient for investigating many parameters of the phenomenon. However, exposures to odors in natural environments often occur over far longer periods, and the resulting adaptations may differ *qualitatively* from short-term olfactory adaptation. For example, studies show that even brief periods of odorant stimulation produce transient reductions in receptors in the olfactory *epithelium*, a process termed "**receptor fatigue**". Prolonged odor stimulation, however, could produce more long-lasting reductions in response, possibly involving structures higher in the central nervous system *pathway*.

3. According to the passage, the phenomenon of olfactory adaptation may cause individuals who are reexposed to an odorous environment after an extended absence to
	1. experience a heightened perception of the odor
	1. perceive the odor as being less intense than it was upon first exposure
	1. return to their original level of perception of the odor
	1. exhibit a decreased tolerance for the odorous environment
	1. experience the phenomenon of adaptation in other sensory systems

4. The passage asserts which of the following about the exposures involved in the **"research on olfactory adaptation"**?
	1. [O] The exposures are of **long enough** duration for researchers to investigate many aspects of olfactory adaptation
	1. The exposures have rarely consisted of reexposures following extended absences from the odorous environment.
	1. The exposures are intended to reproduce the relatively transient olfactory changes typical of exposures to odors in natural environments.
	1. Those exposures of relatively short duration are often insufficient to produce the phenomenon of receptor fatigue in study subjects.
	1. [?] Those exposures lasting several hours produce reductions in receptors in the olfactory epithelium that are similar to the reductions caused by prolonged odor stimulation.

5. The author of the passage discusses **"receptor fatigue"** primarily in order to
	1. explain the physiological process through which long-lasting reductions in response are thought to be produced
	1. provide an example of a process that subjects would probably not experience during a prolonged period of odorant stimulation
	1. [O] help illustrate how the information gathered from most olfactory research may not be sufficient to describe the effects of extended exposures to odors
	1. [?] show how studies of shrot-term olfactory adaptation have only accounted for the reductions in response that follow relatively brief absences from an odorous environment
	1. qualify a statement about the severity and duration of the perceptual changes caused by exposure to chronically present ambient odors

Newspaper *Editorial*:

Last year, Mayor Stephens established a special law-enforcement task force with the avowed mission of eradicating corruption in city government. The mayor's handpicked task force has now begun prosecuting a dozen city officials. Since all of these officials were appointed by Mayor Bixby, Mayor Stephens' predecessor and longtime political foe, it is clear that those being prosecuted have been targeted because of their political affiliations.

6. Which of the following, if true, **most weakens** the editorial's argument?
	1. Complaints of official corruption in city government have decreased since the anticorruption task force began operating.
	1. Former mayor Bixby did not publicly oppose Mayor Stephens' establishment of the anticorruption task force
	1. Almost all of the officials who have served in city government for any length of time are *appointees* of Mayor Bixby.
	1. All of the members of the anticorruption task force had other jobs in city government before the task force was formed
	1. During the last mayoral election campaign, then-Mayor Bixby hotly disputed the current mayor's claim that there was widespread corruption in city government.

Among academics involved in the study of Northern Renaissance prints (reproducible graphic artworks), an **orthodox position** can be said to have emerged. This position regards Renaissance prints as **passive** representations of their time-documents that reliably record contemporary events, opinions, and beliefs-and therefore as an important means of accessing the popular contemporary *consciousness*. In contrast, pioneering studies such as those by Scribner and Moxey take a strikingly different approach, according to which Northern Renaissance prints were purposeful, active, and important shaping forces in the communities that produced them. Scribner, for example, contends that religious and political prints of the German Reformation (ca 1517-1555) functioned as popular propaganda: tools in a vigorous campaign aimed at altering people's behavior, attitudes, and beliefs. 

7. The passage suggests that an adherent to the "orthodox position" would agree with which of the following statements?
	1. Northern Renaissance prints should be regarded as passive representations of their time
	1. Northern Renaissance prints were part of a campaign aimed at altering contemporary thinking.
	1. Northern Renaissance prints provide reliable records of contemporary events, opinions, and beliefs.

8. Replacement of the word "**passive**" with which of the following words results in the least change in meaning for the passage?
	1. *disinterested*
	1. submissive
	1. *flaccid*
	1. *supine*
	1. *unreceptive*

*Geese* can often be seen grazing in coastal salt marshes. Unfortunately, their intense grazing removes the grassy covering, exposing marsh sediment; this increases evaporation, which in turn increases salt concentration in marsh sediments. Because of this increased concentration, regrowth of plants is minimal, leading to increased erosion, which leads to a decrease in the fertile *topsoil*, leading to even less regrowth. In time, the salt marsh becomes a *mudflat*. This process challenges one of the most widely held beliefs about the dynamics of salt-marsh ecosystems: *supposedly*, consumers such as geese do not play a large role in controlling the productivity of marsh systems. Rather, the **standard view** claims, marshes are controlled by bottom-up factors, such as nutrients and physical factors.

9. According to the passage, which of the following is a widely held belief about geese?
	1. They are not often seen grazing in coastal salt marshes.
	1. [?] They are not the primary consumers in salt-marsh ecosystem.
	1. [O] They play only a minor role in the productivity of salt-marsh ecosystems.
	1. They are the primary determinants of which resources will thrive in coastal salt marshes.
	1. They control the productivity of salt-marsh ecosystems through a bottom-up process.

10. The author discuss **"the standard view"** most likely in order to identify a view that
	1. explains the occurrence of the chain of events described in the passage
	1. provides a summary of the chain of events described in the passage
	1. [O] is called into question by the chain of events described in the passage
	1. [?] advocates reassessment of the widely held belief described in the passage
	1. is undermined by the widely held belief described in the passage
