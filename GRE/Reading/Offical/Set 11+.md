Abolitionist Frederick Douglass' move to Rochester, New York, in 1847 was a major step in his finding his own intellectual path. Along with much of the rest of western New York, Rochester became fertile ground for an antislavery movement that dissented from that led by William Lloyd Garrison, **with whom Douglass had previously been aligned**. Unlike the Garrisonians, who believed the Union established by the United States Constitution must be dissolved in order to abolish slavery, many Rochester activists began to see both the Constitution and the political process as invaluable instruments for achieving that goal. During the 1840s and 1850s, __many abolitionists had become frustrated by the failure of Garrison's method of moral persuasion__. They turned instead to politics to fight slavery.

1. Which of the following statements best describes the function of the __highlighted sentence__?
	1. It emphasizes Garrison's popularity among abolitionists prior to the 1840s.
	1. It points out a similarity between Garrison's position and that of Douglass prior to the latter's move to Rochester.
	1. It illustrates the extent to which Garrison *disdained* politics as a tool to achieve abolition.
	1. [O] It explains the motivation behind the Rochester abolitionists' split with Garrison.
	1. It suggests that the previous alliance between Douglass and Garrison has been overemphasized.

2. The author implies that Frederick Douglass' relocation to Rochester was important because
	1. many Rochester activists doubted William Lloyd Garrison's commitment to the abolitionist movement
	1. Rochester was populated by abolitionists who believed in the efficacy of moral persuasion
	1. [O] the prevailing political climate there reinforced Douglass' growing philosophical distance from Garrison
	1. activists there recognized Douglass' capacity to become a leader in the abolitionist cause
	1. activists there were focused on how to amend the Constitution in order to advance abolitionist goals

The cycle of fluctuation in *snowshoe hare* populations is unusual among animal species in that it is **remarkably regular**-peaking every eight to eleven years-and broadly synchronized over a vast area. Declines from peak levels are initiated by markedly lower *overwinter* survival of young hares, sharp decreases in birth rates, and a declining survival rate for adult hares. The onset of population increases is brought about by greatly improved rates of survival and birth.

Some biologists hypothesize that the cycle begins when peak snowshoe hare populations exceed their winter food supply; resulting malnutrition triggers a population decline. As hare numbers fall, the ratio of predators to hares increases, as does the impact of predation on the hare population. This extends the decline beyond the period of winter food shortage. Hare scarcity then causes predator population declines, and with fewer predators and more abundant winter food, the hare population begins another cyclic increase. The high mobility of predators responding to local differences in hare abundance contributes to interregional *synchrony*.

3. The passage suggests that population fluctuations in many other animal species differ from those of the snowshoe hare in that population fluctuations **in other species**
	1. are less regular due to more erratic changes in predator levels
	1. typically occur over a longer time period
	1. are synchronized over larger areas
	1. are less dependent on food availability
	1. [O] are typically less predictable

4. According to the passage, biologists have suggested which of the following about snowshoe hare population fluctuations?
	1. Their regularity is due to the persistent threat of malnourishment that young hares face.
	1. They are similar in length to those of other species of hare.
	1. Their synchrony can be partly explained by the ability of predators to change the areas in which they hunt.
	1. Their variation from region to region is partly due to regional differences in the availability of alternate prey for predators.
	1. Their regularity is due to the constant availability of the food sources hares rely on.

5. The passage suggests that which of the following is true of fluctuations in snowshoe hare populations?
	1. Changes in hare population levels are not highly correlated with changes in predator population levels.
	1. [O] Hare populations in one region are unlikely to peak at the same time that populations in nearby regions are at the lowest point of the cycle.
	1. The *regularity* of hare population fluctuations is greater in regions where populations peak every eight years than in regions where they peak every eleven years.
	1. In areas where hare population cycles are greater than eleven years, predator mobility is unusually high.
	1. Fluctuations in hare populations vary greatly from region to region, depending on available winter food supply.

The appearance of the star Gamma Cephei varies regularly. The existence of a planet circling a star can cause regular variation in its appearance. However, the regular variation in Gamma Cephei's appearance is no reason to think that there is a planet circling it, since **the slow rotation of a star can also cause its appearance to vary regularly** and ____________.

6. Which of the following most logically completes the argument?
	1. many stars that have planets circling them rotate slowly
	1. Gamma Cephei varies more in appearance than many other stars do
	1. it is easier to determine the speed at which a star rotates than to determine whether a planet is circling it
	1. analysis of sunspot activity on Gamma Cephei shows that it rotates slowly
	1. Gamma Cephei is only one of many stars that vary regularly in appearance

The first printers in Europe modeled their books very closely on handwritten manuscripts, leading to an **easy acceptance of print** among readers but to significant missteps in trying to apply technology. __The attempt to replicate manuscripts' appearance encouraged experiments in two- or three-color printing__. This was intricate and expensive work, and many printers found it preferable to pay expert calligraphers to manually adorn unbound sheets with additional colors. Illuminated headings and decoration familiar from the manuscript age had helped lead readers through the text. To achieve similar effects, printers began to experiment with new arrangements of type, using large fonts for headings and substituting decorative *woodcuts* for hand-executed initial letters. Ultimately, readers came to accept books printed in just one color.

7. The author suggests that readers of the earliest books printed in Europe
	1. could not afford books printed in multiple colors
	1. considered the books inferior to handwritten manuscripts
	1. suggested certain improvements to printers
	1. were skeptical about an unproven technology
	1. [O] found the books' appearance to be *reassuringly* familiar

8. Which of the following statements best describes the function of the __highlighted portion__ of the passage?
	1. It provides some historical context for an earlier assertion.
	1. [O] It provides a specific example of an approach mentioned earlier in the passage.
	1. It *qualifies* a claim made earlier in the passage.
	1. It corrects a misconception regarding early printed books.
	1. It anticipates an argument that is discounted by later evidence.

Noting that bison herds appear to graze selectively in areas occupied by prairie dog colonies, Coppock hypothesized that the attraction is due to improved forage quality: prairie dogs' own grazing activities alter herbage dynamics, plant species composition, and nutrient cycling. __The colonies' territory contains relatively little low-quality mature standing *herbage* and is characterized by communities of plants that are high in *crude protein* and highly *digestible*.__ However, such effects are not produced only by prairie dogs. Willms showed that sites selectively grazed by cattle had reduced standing dead plant material, altered species composition, and increased soil nitrates, ammonium, and available phosphorus. In fact, long-term, intensive use by any grazer will cause comparable changes in plant communities.

9. The __highlighted sentence__ serves primarily to
	1. provide information about the kinds of forage preferred by prairie dogs
	1. refute a particular claim about the forage methods of prairie dogs
	1. [O] specify what makes forage conditions created by prairie dogs appealing to bison
	1. suggest that prairie dogs' activities can cause environmental degradation
	1. identify characteristics that influence prairie dogs' selection of sites to colonize

10. __For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The author of the passage would most likely agree with which of the following statements about **mature standing herbage**?
	1. It tends to be fairly easy for grazing animals to digest.
	1. It is likely to predominate at sites with increased soil nitrates.
	1. [O] Its abundance at a site will make the site less attractive to bison.
