## Questions

Island animal populations are well-known for the extent of their divergence from each other and from source populations on the mainland. Mayr argued that **these differences are often triggered by random sampling when island populations are founded by only a few colonizing individuals**. The *resultant* founder effects-changes in the genetic and *phenotypic* composition of a population due to founding by a limited number of individuals-have been proposed as an important cause of evolutionary divergence for the past half-century. However, an __alternative explanation__ is that island environments differ from one another and from the mainland environment, and **these ecological differences result in divergent natural selection**. The long-term evolutionary significance of founder effects also has been questioned because their *imprint* may be short-lived.

1. Proponents of the __"alternative explanation"__ would most likely agree with which of the following statements?
	1. The small number of colonizing individuals plays a key role in the evolutionary divergence of island populations.
	1. Ecological factors, rather than founder effects, play a key role in the evolutionary divergence of island populations.
	1. The evolutionary divergence of island populations is usually a short-lived phenomenon.
	1. Founder effects often interact with environmental factors to produce evolutionary divergence.
	1. Biologists have largely overlooked the wider evolutionary significance of founder effects.

2. Which of the following statements best describes the overall organization of the passage?
	1. [O] An observation is made, then competing explanations for it are presented.
	1. A problem is defined, then a partial solution to it is proposed.
	1. An argument is offered, then an stated assumption on which it depends is analyzed.
	1. A question is posed, then a possible answer to it is examined and rejected.
	1. Two competing positions are developed, then the greater validity of one is explained.

**Most mammals reach sexual maturity when their growth rates are in decline**, whereas humans experience a growth *spurt* during adolescence. Whether apes experience an adolescent growth spurt is still undecided. In the 1950s, data on captive chimpanzees collected by James Gavan appeared devoid of evidence of an adolescent growth spurt in these apes. In a recent reanalysis of Gavan's data, however, zoologist Elizabeth Watts has found that as chimpanzees reach sexual maturity, the growth rate of their limbs accelerates. **Most biologists, however, are skeptical that this is a humanlike adolescent growth spurt**. While the human adolescent growth spurt is physically obvious and affects virtually the entire body, **the chimpanzee's increased growth rate is detectable only through sophisticated mathematical analysis.** Moreover, according to scientist Holly Smith, the growth rate increase in chimpanzees begins when 86% of full skeletal growth has been attained, whereas human adolescence generally **commences** when 77 percent of full skeletal growth has occurred.

3. Which of the following best describes the main idea of the passage?
	1. Researchers have long disagreed about whether data collected in the 1950s indicate that chimpanzees and other apes experience an adolescent growth spurt.
	1. Research data collected on chimpanzees living in captivity are inconclusive with respect to chimpanzees living in the wild.
	1. The notion that apes do not experience an adolescent growth spurt has been confirmed by research conducted since.
	1. Although the idea that apes experience an adolescent growth has received some support, most biologists remain unconvinced.
	1. Although researchers agree that chimpanzees do not experience an adolescent growth spurt, they are divided in their opinions of whether this is true of other apes.

4. The passage mentions which of the following as one of the reasons **why most biologists remain skeptical** that chimpanzees experience a humanlike adolescent growth spurt?
	1. Chimpanzees do not experience a demonstrable increase in growth rate until they are fully sexually mature.
	1. The increase in growth rate that chimpanzees undergo at sexual maturity is less apparent than that of humans.
	1. The increase in growth rate once regarded as a humanlike adolescent growth spurt in chimpanzees is too sporadic to be regarded as significant.
	1. Not all chimpanzees undergo a calculable growth spurt.
	1. Watt's approach to analyzing data is considered to be highly unorthodox.

5. The passage suggests which of the following about the adolescent growth spurt that takes place in humans?
	1. Its primary effects are found in parts of the body other than the limbs.
	1. It is **generally completed** by the time 77 percent of full skeletal growth is attained.
	1. It is normally detectable without the assistance of sophisticated mathematical analysis.
	1. The rate of growth is much faster at the beginning of puberty than at any other time.
	1. The estimated growth rate varies depending on the methods of measurement that are used.

People who are infected with the hepatitis-C virus develop antibodies to the virus. Current tests that are used to screen donated blood for *hepatitis* C do so **by detecting the presence of such antibodies**. All blood donations are screened, and any donation that tests positive for the presence of such antibodies is discarded. Nonetheless, **there still remains a small risk of hepatitis C being transmitted by blood donations,** since __________.

6. Which of the following most logically completes the argument?
	1. the number of people infected with the hepatitis-C virus has risen significantly in the past several years
	1. the antibody detected by the screening process is sometimes produced even when the hepatitis-C virus is not present
	1. people can be infected with the hepatitis-C virus for several years without knowing that they have the disease
	1. it often takes over two months for someone infected with the hepatitis-C virus to develop antibodies to it
	1. only a small percentage of blood donations contain antibodies to the hepatitis-C virus

In their study of women in tribal communities in India, Reena Shah and Danièle Bélanger found that being employed outside the home had a negative effect on women's utilization of maternal healthcare services. **In theory, working women are assumed to have greater freedom and greater control over resources than are nonworking women, and hence should be more likely to utilize healthcare facilities.** Shah and Bélanger's __finding__ may be related to the fact that tribal women employed outside the home mostly work in construction or agriculture on daily wages, and hence are less likely to visit a healthcare center during working hours. It is further possible that nonworking women belong to households with high standards of living, and hence would be more likely to seek medical care.

7. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. reconcile two competing theories
	1. account for a finding at odds with a theory
	1. explain how a finding corroborates a theory
	1. describe the evolution of a theory
	1. apply a theory to a problem

8. Which of the following statements, if true, would most **challenge an explanation for the "finding"** advanced in the passage?
	1. Tribal women who work in fields **other than construction and agriculture** do not utilize maternal healthcare services significantly less than do nonworking tribal women.
	1. **Daily wages** for tribal women working in construction and agriculture jobs are **no greater than** they are for tribal women working in other fields.
	1. Healthcare centers that tribal women can access and afford are generally open outside the normal working hours for construction and agriculture jobs.
	1. Tribal women who utilize maternal healthcare services **tend to be healthier overall** than are tribal women who do not utilize maternal healthcare services.
	1. Tribal women seeking maternal healthcare usually **utilize informal services** rather than visit formal healthcare centers.

English-born photographer Eadweard Muybridge was renowned in the 1860s for the clouds in his landscapes. __The chemistry of the *wet-plate photography* used then made yellows appear far darker than they are, and blues far lighter.__ **The sky in most nineteenth-century photography is pale and featureless**, because correctly exposed rocks and trees meant overexposed skies. Muybridge tolerated more darkness in the foreground than other photographers; his shorter exposures and darker images improved his ability to photograph skies in the first place. He also created an archive of cloud photographs that he could *superimpose* over pale skies in landscapes. Finally, Muybridge pioneered the use of a spring-operated shutter that allowed extremely brief sky exposures with longer exposures for the landscape below.

9. In the passage, the function of the __highlighted sentence__ is to
	1. **emphasize the fragility** of prints made through the wet-plate method of photography
	1. suggest that any absence of pronounced yellows in Muybridge's landscapes **should be attributed** to the photographic process he used
	1. argue that Muybridge's contributions to chemistry were driven by the **limited photographic technologies** available in his day
	1. propose a reason **why Muybridge chose to focus** on landscape photography
	1. explain why depicting skies was challenging for photographers of Muybridge's era

10. Which of the following is mentioned in the passage as a method Muybridge used to produce specific effects in his landscapes?
	1. Overexposing the sky in his pictures
	1. Adding photos of clouds to prints with pale skies
	1. Using different shutter exposures on the same picture
