## Questions

Meltzoff and Moore reported experiments showing that human newborns possess the ability to imitate certain facial expressions, such as a protruding tongue or an open mouth. Yet numerous researchers challenge Meltzoff's interpretation that such *neonatal* imitation is the origin of later imitation, which appears at approximately eight to twelve months of age. These researchers point out that **the neonatal imitative response disappears or is lessened at approximately two months.** Moreover, since **in follow-up studies only one type of imitative** response toward a facial expression (that is, tongue protrusion) **was observed**, some researchers assert that neonatal imitation is not imitation at all but may simply be a form of exploratory behavior in response to interesting stimuli.

1. According to the passage, those who challenge "Meltzoff's interpretation" do so on the basis that it
	1. implies inaccurate predictions
	1. lacks testable consequences
	1. assumes a discredited theory
	1. [O] leaves an unexplained *gap*
	1. involves circular reasoning

2. The passage implies which of the following about the **experimental results reported by Meltzoff and Moore**?
	1. [O] They were, **at best**, only partially *borne out* by subsequent studies.
	1. They cast doubt on the validity of a particular claim about newborns.
	1. They formed the basis for revised interpretations of other behaviors of newborns.
	1. They derived from a methodology that turned out to be flawed.
	1. They challenged the distinction between imitative and nonimitative behavior in newborns.

A __widespread concern__ in early eighteenth-century Britain that the institution of marriage was deteriorating into a mere business agreement, a cynical means of increasing wealth, was reflected in the media of the time. In the theater, for example, the *Restoration comedy* of manners, with its celebration of *libertinism* and *portrayal* of marriage as a social, and therefore artificial, institution, gave way to sentimental comedies like The Conscious Lovers, which celebrated the pure, instinctive love of its central characters while downplaying matters of wealth and status. New periodicals, such as the wildly popular Spectator, devoted many issues to the evils of mercenary marriages and to the glories of choosing love over money. However, the very **popularity of such works calls into question the existence of any real trend toward mercenary marriage**. Admittedly, the growing use and complexity of marriage settlements (the transfer of family property from one generation to the next upon a daughter's marriage) during this period meant that among the elite, at least, marriage contracts looked increasingly like business contracts. However, it should be noted that marriage had long been used by the elite to cement political or social bonds and to enhance family wealth.

3. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. question whether early eighteenth-century British concerns about an increase in the instances of mercenary marriage were supported in fact
	1. illustrate the increasingly mercenary condition of marriage in early eighteenth-century Britain by means of **examples from the media** of the time
	1. suggest that current scholarship concerned with early eighteenth-century British views of marriage is flawed
	1. examine some of the factors that caused a trend toward mercenary marriage in early eighteenth-century Britain
	1. compare two different views of marriage as they were reflected in certain media of early eighteenth-century Britain

4. The author of the passage states that which of the following casts doubt on the validity of the "widespread concern"?
	1. The popularity of the Restoration comedy of manners
	1. The growing complexity of marriage settlements
	1. Increasing similarities between marriage and business contracts
	1. A rising tendency among the elite classes to marry for love rather than money
	1. The success of works in different media celebrating love over money

5. The author of the passage mentions The Conscious Lovers in order to
	1. give a representative example of a Restoration comedy of manners
	1. show how a particular concern was reflected in the media
	1. provide support for the assertion that marriage had become a mercenary institution
	1. suggest that certain anxieties were exacerbated by the media
	1. provide an example of a theatrical work that challenged the institution of marriage

The great majority of extant decorated artifacts from the Middle Period of the Byzantine Empire are objects that were designed for ecclesiastical use. But even those decorated **artifacts with no apparent ecclesiastical function are almost all decorated with religious scenes and symbols**. This material evidence strongly indicates that in the Middle Period of the Byzantine Empire, **there was little *scope* for artisans to create decorative works of an entirely *secular* nature.**

6. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
	1. Since Byzantine monasteries tended to be centers of learning, even those extant manuscripts from the Middle Period of the Byzantine Empire that discuss purely **secular subjects were produced by monks** living in religious communities.
	1. [O] Unlike objects stored in private houses and palace treasuries, objects stored in Byzantine ecclesiastical treasuries were generally treated with reverence by invaders over the centuries.
	1. Textiles of the Middle Period of the Byzantine Empire that were decorated with religious motifs were as likely to be used for the decoration of private houses as they were to be used for the decoration of religious sanctuaries.
	1. Nearly all of the extant artifacts of the Middle Period of the Byzantine Empire that were not decorated were artifacts with no apparent ecclesiastical function.
	1. Some of the most richly adorned of the extant Middle Period Byzantine objects decorated with religious motifs were artifacts with no apparent ecclesiastical function.

Pikas are small, rabbitlike mammals that live high in the mountains on rocky slopes in western North America. During the 1990s, ecologist Eric Beever revisited 24 locations-all in the Great Basin of the western United States-where pikas had been observed between 1898 and 1947, and he found that seven of the original sites no longer had pikas. The pika populations that had vanished were those at lower, warmer elevations, which suggests climate warming is involved. Generally, when climate warming changes habitat, animals move either to higher, colder elevations or farther north. However, pikas in the Great Basin are not easily able to migrate in this way. They live on mountain ranges that are separated from other mountains by inhospitable valleys. __Further, even the most widely roving pikas tend to move less than one kilometer from their birthplaces during their lifetimes.__

7. __For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ Which of the following, if true, would **strengthen the argument that climate change was involved in the disappearance** of certain pika populations?
	1. Outside the Great Basin, many pika populations are dwindling.
	1. Some plants that used to be part of pika habitats at lower elevations are now found only at higher elevations.
	1. Certain other animal populations in the Great Basin region have actually experienced modest increases in numbers.

8. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence in the context of the passage as a whole?
	1. To elaborate on an explanation of a difference between pikas and other animal populations
	1. To help explain the statement about pikas that was made in the preceding sentence
	1. To present new information that qualifies the findings presented in the second sentence
	1. To minimize the significance of information about pikas presented in the preceding sentence
	1. To provide evidence that apparently contradicts the observation initially described in the passage

**In 1971, hot *on the heels of* plate-tectonic theory's acceptance**, J. W. Morgan suggested that hotspots-areas of intense volcanism such as Hawaii, Yellowstone, and Iceland-are fueled by *plumes* of hot material arising in the deep mantle and punching through the *mobile* shallow mantle and crust to the surface. Morgan's theory was developed to explain the time-progressive trails of volcanoes associated with some hotspots and the hotspots' apparent *fixity* relative to one another. If the sources of the volcanism were rooted in the immobile deep mantle, they would not move relative to one another and the plates at the surface would drift above, bearing away trails of volcanism. According to a recent article by geologist G. R. Foulger, **however**, although hotspots do exist, **they do not have time-progressive volcanic trails and are not fixed relative to one another.**

9. The passage implies that Morgan's suggestion was
	1. presented as a challenge to a newly accepted theory
	1. [O] made on the basis of considerations that have since been questioned
	1. rejected despite its success in explaining the phenomena it was intended to explain
	1. supplanted by a theory that was more general in scope
	1. intended to account for observations that appeared to contradict an accepted theory

10. __For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The passage suggests which of the following about the relationship between the theory of plate tectonics and Morgan's suggestion?
	1. Morgan's suggestion indirectly helped to discredit certain aspects of the theory of drifting tectonic plates.
	1. [O] Morgan's suggestion assumes that the theory of drifting tectonic plates is correct.
	1. Evidence that contradicts Morgan's suggestion must also, by virtue of that fact, contradict the theory of drifting tectonic plates.

## Review
1. 细节题
	2. 文中没有提到任何关于试验的信息。
	3. Meltzoff 's interpretation 没有提到任何假设。
	4. 概括反对者认为的缺点：disappears or is lessened at approximately two months。

2. 推理题
	4. 不是方法，而是實驗本身就有問題

5. 目的题
	1. the conscious lovers 是 sentimental comedies 的例子，而不是 restoration comedy的
	2. 键词定位到首段具体戏剧的事例，根据文章结构，可知这些事例是用来支持首句widespread concern

6. 削弱题
	1. 工匠全是僧人——工匠全是僧人不更说明愿意做宗教图案吗？不是削弱
	2. 宗教器皿被更好尊重——侵略者不尊重secular图案的器皿，因此毁坏，所以没有了，并不是因为工匠他不做，削弱！
	3. 纺织品和器皿一个情况——纺织品一个熊样更说明了工匠很可能只做宗教图案。不削弱！
	4. 朴素器皿非宗教用途——跟工匠有啥关系，又不是他们绘图的
	5. 宗教绘图器皿不用于宗教——我工匠给你绘上去了，因为我只画宗教，至于你器皿是不是因为被备胎了而吃冷饭就不是我该管的问题了。没有削弱！

9. 推理题
	2. 文章以Morgan理论的背景(版块构造理论)开始介绍其理论，该理论重点针对的解释对象是夏威夷等火山集中地区，认为这些火山是由来自深层地幔处的熔岩穿过移动的浅层地幔和地壳到达地面的。按照Morgan的理论，如果火山源自固定的地幔深处，火山源之间的位置相对固定，相对于表层移动的地壳也是固定的，就会形成移动的痕迹。
	3. 文章根本没有提及“its success in explaining the phenomena it was intended to explain”,这个属于过度推理。虽然Morgan的理论是用来解释trails的，而后面另外的学者认为trails其实不存在
