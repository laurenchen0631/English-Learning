## Questions

The compositional **similarity of the Moon and Earth's mantle** and the recognized importance of **large impacts in the early solar system**, together with the large angular momentum present in the Earth-Moon system, have led to __the theory__ that **the Moon formed after a Mars-sized object collided with the growing Earth**. Simulations predict that much of the preexisting layered structure of Earth was obliterated and much of the impacting material thrown back into orbit, creating a post-impact accretion disk surrounding proto-Earth. Simulations also predict that the Moon consists primarily of material from the impacting object, and not material from proto-Earth. **This computational model is challenged**, however, by a __remarkable similarity__ in oxygen *isotopes* found between lunar and Earth rocks, raising **questions about the partitioning of material** during impact.

1. According to the passage, the __"remarkable similarity"__ best suggests that
	1. Earth did not collide with a Mars-sized object
	1. the object that collided with Earth did not provide most of the Moon's material
	1. Earth's layered structure was largely obliterated by a collision
	1. Earth and its Moon were formed at approximately the same time
	1. the object that collided with Earth was probably not Mars-sized

2. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about "the theory"?
	1. [O] It is not contradicted by the similarity in oxygen isotopes found between lunar and Earth rocks.
	1. It is based primarily on the large angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system.
	1. It has been undermined by recent computer simulations of an object colliding with proto-Earth.
	1. It is unable to account for the formation of an accretion disk around proto-Earth.
	1. It is difficult to reconcile with the compositional similarity of the Moon and Earth's mantle.

Many *Anglo* writers of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the area that eventually became New Mexico as *virgin* territory without traditions and roots. **But for Fabiola Cabeza de Baca, this landscape meant a long tradition of Hispanic families** not only tied to the land but nourished by it.

Cabeza de Baca's We Fed Them Cactus recounts the changes endured by her family because of their dependence on the land. Cabeza de Baca contrasts Anglo writers' perception of the __"plains"__ with Hispanic families' perception of the land as __"fields"__ of herbs and cactus, domesticated and accessible. Her family's relationship to land, weather, and landscape is all-important. She writes, "Rain for us made history. . . . The droughts were as impressed on our souls as the rains. When we spoke of the *Armistice* of World War I, we always said, 'The drought of 1918 when the Armistice was signed.'"

3. The author of the passage is primarily concerned with
	1. depicting a way of life
	1. presenting a Hispanic writer's point of view
	1. summarizing the plot of a literary work
	1. appraising the work of a Hispanic writer
	1. comparing dissimilar styles of writing

4. The author of the passage mentions __"plains"__ and __"fields"__ primarily in order to
	1. provide a contrast between fictionalized and historical events
	1. illustrate the eccentricities of Cabeza de Baca's writing style
	1. contrast the land owned by Anglo settlers with that owned by Cabeza de Baca's family
	1. portray the differences between the attitudes of Anglo and of Hispanic writers toward the landscape
	1. emphasize the changes that occurred to the landscape during Cabeza de Baca's lifetime

5. The information in the passage suggests that We Fed Them Cactus includes which of the following?
	1. Anecdotes about Anglo writers
	1. Commentary about political issues
	1. Incidents from Cabeza de Baca's personal experience
	1. Fictionalized accounts of historical events
	1. Use of sociological theories to interpret a family's experience

When an old tree was felled, a very thin ring was detected among the oldest rings in the *stump*. When the width of rings, each corresponding to one year's growth, was correlated with local rainfall records, it was found, as expected, that thicker rings had occurred in years with abundant rain. **Therefore the very thin ring, which dates to 1662, before rainfall records were kept, indicates that a severe drought** occurred that year.

6. Which of the following, if true, most **seriously weakens** the argument given?
	1. Tree rings allow for a very precise and reliable way of determining the age of a tree.
	1. The decrease of light in rainy years was not a factor that would have limited the growth of the tree.
	1. Some species of trees have methods of storing water between years, and thus the thickness of their rings does not vary with year-to-year rainfall.
	1. There is independent evidence to suggest that the local patterns of rainfall changed significantly over the lifetime of the tree.
	1. [O] Severe infestations of caterpillars can abruptly reduce the growth of trees.

Art is fragile; architecture is not. Paintings and sculptures speak to the quiet as well as the *strife-ridden* aspects of modern life. They only thrive in a carefully nurtured context-hospitable human spaces that invite lingering and revisiting-which is why *the genius of the best curators is in their eye for juxtaposition and presentation as much as it is in scholarship and acquisition.* Architecture needs to be strong and confident; but the *instant* museum architecture becomes ostentatiously strong and overconfident, the art is going to wither. The Tate Modern is a building that will not stop speaking and let us attend to the art.

7. __For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The passage implies that **a problem with "ostentatiously strong and overconfident" architecture** for art museums is that viewers will
	1. avoid certain museums that they otherwise would have visited
	1. linger excessively in order to appreciate the building's architecture
	1. [O] find themselves distracted from paying attention to the art

8. __For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The passage points to which of the following as **criteria by which art museum curators** should be evaluated?
	1. The aesthetic context that they provide for any individual artwork
	1. The social and cultural issues that their collections address
	1. The artworks that they obtain for their museum collections

Despite __clues__ that a single master building plan tied Egypt's Sphinx to the pyramid and temples built by the pharaoh Khafre (who reigned from 2520 to 2494 b.c.), some archaeologists continued to speculate that other pharaohs built the statue. In 1980, however, German geologist **Tom Aigner suggested a novel way of showing that the Sphinx was an integral part of Khafre's larger building complex.** Examining the fossil fingerprints of __limestone samples__ from the Sphinx and the nearby Sphinx Temple attributed to Khafre, Aigner traced the blocks used to build the wall of the temple to the ditch surrounding the Sphinx. It would seem that workmen hauled away the *quarried* blocks to construct the temple as the Sphinx was being carved out of the stone.

9. The passage suggests which of the following about the __"clues"__?
	1. They intensified debates over the Sphinx's origin.
	1. They undermined the theory that attributed the Sphinx to Khafre.
	1. They failed to convince a number of archaeologists.
	1. They indicated that the Sphinx was built after 2494 b.c.
	1. They were an integral part of Aigner's solution.

10. According to the passage, the __"limestone samples"__ allowed Aigner to establish
	1. the identity of the pharaoh who built the Sphinx Temple
	1. [O] the origins of the material used to build the Sphinx Temple
	1. the techniques used in the Sphinx's construction
	1. the interval between the completion of the Sphinx and the construction of its surrounding structures
	1. the differences between the materials used to build the Sphinx and those used to build its surrounding structures

## Review
2. 推理题
	1. 末句同位素的相似性，质疑的是撞击模型中物质的分配，不是撞击理论本事。
	5. 错在关键词：mantle。原文说的是oxygen isotopes。

7. 推理题
	1. 对应：The Tate Modern is a building that will not stop speaking and let us attend to the art. 只说了太热烈的喋喋不休邀请你来，并没有说你原本想来结果不想去了
