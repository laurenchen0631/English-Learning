A portrait type that appeared with relentless frequency in eighteenth-century England is the familiar image of a gentleman *poised* with one hand inside his partially *unbuttoned* *waistcoat*. Standard interpretations of this portrait posture offer observations of *correspondence* - demonstrating either that it mirrors actual social behavior or that it borrows from classical *statuary*. Such explanations, however, illuminate neither the source of this curious convention nor the reason for its popularity, it is true that in real life the "hand-in" was a common *stance* for elite men. Still, there were other ways of *comporting* the body that did not become winning portrait formulas. And even if the "hand-in" portrait does resemble certain classical statues, what accounts for the adoption of this particular pose?

1. Which of the following might provide an **explanation** for the popularity of hand-in portraits that would **satisfy the author of the passage?**
	1. [O] An eighteenth-century English etiquette *manual* discussing the social implications of the "hand-in" stance
	1. A comprehensive catalogue of eighteenth-century English portraits that showed what proportion of portraits depicted gentlemen in the "hand-in" stance
	1. [O] A passage from an eighteenth-century English novel in which a gentlemen considers what stance to adopt when his portrait is painted

Recently an usually high number of dolphins have been found dead of infectious diseases, and most of these had abnormally high tissue concentrations of certain compounds that, even in low concentrations, reduce dolphins' resistance to infection. The only source of these compounds in the dolphins' environment is boat paint. Therefore, since dolphins rid their bodies of the compounds rapidly once exposure ceases, their mortality rate should decline rapidly if such boat paints are banned.

2. Which of the following, **if ture, most strengthens the argument**?
	1. The levels of the compounds typically used in boat paints today are lower than they were in boat paints manufactured a decade ago.
	1. In high concentrations, the compounds are toxic to many types of marine animals.
	1. [O] The compounds break down into harmless substances after a few months of exposure to water or air.
	1. High tissue levels of the compounds have recently been found in some marine animals, but there is no record of any of those animals dying in usually large numbers recently.
	1. The compounds do not leach out of the boat paint if the paint is applied exactly in accordance with the manufacturer's directions. 

The work of English writer _Aphra Behn_(1640-1689) changed markedly during the 1680s, as she turned from writing plays to writing prose narratives. According to literary *critic* _Rachel Carnell_, most scholars view this change as primarily motivated by financial considerations: earning a living by writing for the theatre became more difficult in the 1680s, so Behn tried various other types of prose genres in the hope of finding another lucrative medium. In fact, a long *epistolary* scandal novel that she wrote in the mid-1680s sold quite well. Yet, as Carnell notes, Behn did not repeat this approach in her other prose works; instead, she turned to writing shorter, more serious novels, even though only about half of these were published during her lifetime Carnell argues that Behn, whose stage productions are primarily comedies, may have turned to an emerging literary form, the novel, in a conscious attempt to criticize, and subvert *for her own ends*, the conventions and ideology of a well-established form of her day, the dramatic tragedy. 

Carnell acknowledges that Behn admired the skill of such contemporary writers of dramatic tragedy as John Dryden, and that Behn's own comic stage productions displayed the same *partisanship* for the *reigning* *Stuart monarchy* that *characterized* most of the politically oriented dramatic tragedies of her day. However, Carnell argues that Behn took issue with the way in which these writers and plays defined the nature of tragedy. As *prescribed* by Dryden, tragedy was supposed to concern a heroic man who is a public figure and who undergoes a fall that evokes pity from the audience, Carnell points out that Behn's tragic novels focus instead on the plight of little-known women and the private world of the household; even in her few novels featuring protagonists, Behn *insists* on the importance of the crimes *these otherwise heroic figures commit in the domestic sphere*. Moreover, according to Carnell, Behn questioned the view *promulgated* by *monarchist* dramatic tragedies such as Dryden's: that the envisioned "public" political ideal - passive obedience to the nation's king - ought to be mirrored in the private sphere, with family members wholly obedient to a male head of household. Carnell sees Behn's novels not only as rejecting the model of *patriarchal* and hierarchical family order, but also as warning that insisting **on such a parallel** can result in real tragedy *befalling* the members of the domestic sphere. According to Carnell, Behn's choice of literary form underscores the differences between her own approach to crafting a tragic story and that taken in the dramatic tragedies, with their **artificial distinction** between the public and private spheres. Behn's novels engage in the political dialogue of her era by demonstrating that the good of the nation ultimately encompasses more than the good of the public figures who rule it.

3. The passage is primarily concerned with
	1. tracing how Behn's view of the nature of tragedy changed over time
	1. explaining one author's view of Behn's contribution to the development of an emerging literary form
	1. differentiating between the early and the late literary works of Behn
	1. contrasting the approaches to tragedy taken by Behn and by Dryden
	1. [O] presenting one scholar's explanation for a major development in Behn's literary career

4. The passage suggests that Carnell sees Behn's novels featuring male protagonists as differing from dramatic tragedies such as Dryden's featuring male protagonists in that the former
	1. depict these characters as less than heroic in their public actions
	1. [O] emphasize the consequences of these characters' actions in the private sphere
	1. insist on a parallel between the public and the private spheres
	1. are aimed at a predominantly audience
	1. depict family members who disobey these protagonists

5. The passage suggests that Carnell believes Behn held which of the following attitudes about the relationship between the private and public spheres?
	1. The private sphere is more appropriate than is the public sphere as the setting for plays about political events.
	1. [O] The structure of the private sphere should not replicate the hierarchical order of the public sphere
	1. Actions in the private sphere are more fundamental to ensuring the good of the nation than are actions in the public sphere
	1. Crimes committed in the private sphere are likely to cause tragedy in the public sphere rather than vice versa
	1. The private sphere is the mirror in which issues affecting the public sphere can most clearly be seen.

6. It can be inferred from the passage that the **"artificial distinction"** refers to the
	1. practice utilized in dramatic tragedies of providing different structural models for the public and the private spheres
	1. ideology of many dramatic tragedies that advocate passive obedience only in the private sphere and not in the public sphere
	1. convention that drama ought to concern events in the public sphere and that novels ought to concern events in the private sphere
	1. [O] assumption made by the authors of conventional dramatic tragedies that legitimate tragic action occurs only in the public sphere
	1. approach taken by the dramatic tragedies in depicting male and female characters differently, depending on whether their roles were public or private

Extensive housing construction is underway in Pataska Forest, the habitat of a large population of deer. Because deer feed at the edges of forests, these deer will be attracted to the spaces alongside the new roads being cut through Pataska Forest to serve the new residential areas. Consequently, once the housing is occupied, the annual number of the forest's deer hit by cars will be much higher than before construction started.

7. Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
	1. The number of deer hit by commercial vehicles will not increase significantly when the housing is occupied
	1. Deer will be as attracted to the forest edge around new houses as to the forest edge alongside roads.
	1. In years past, the annual number of deer that have been hit by cars on existing roads through Pataska Forest has been very low.
	1. The development will leave sufficient forest to sustain a significant population of deer.
	1. No deer hunting will be allowed in Pataska Forest when the housing is occupied

Historian F. W. Maitland observed that legal documents are the best - indeed, often the only - available evidence about the economic and social history of a given period. Why, then, has it taken so long for historians to focus systematically on the *civil (noncriminal) law* of early modern (sixteenth-to eighteenth-century) England? Maitland offered one reason: the subject requires researchers to "master an extremely formal system of pleading and procedure" Yet the complexities that confront those who would study such materials are not wholly different from those recently *surmounted* by historians of *criminal law* in England during the same period. Another possible explanation for historians' *neglect* of the subject is their **widespread assumption** that most people in early modern England had little contact with civil law. If that were so, the history of legal matters would be of little relevance to general historical *scholarship*. But recent research suggests that civil litigation during the period involved artisans, merchants, professionals, shopkeepers, and farmers, and not merely a narrow, *propertied*, male elite. Moreover, the later sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries saw an extraordinary explosion in civil litigation by both women and men, making this the most litigious era in English history on a *per capita* basis.

8. The author of the passage mentions the *occupations* of those involved in civil litigation in early modern England most likely in order to
	1. suggest that most historians' assumptions about the participants in the civil legal system during that period are probably correct
	1. support the theory that more people participated in the civil legal system than the criminal legal system in England during that period
	1. counter the claim that issues reveal more about a country's ordinary citizens than about its elite
	1. [O] illustrate the wide range of people who used the civil legal system in England during that period
	1. suggest that recent data on people who participated in early modern England's legal system may not be correct

9. The author of the passage suggests which of the following about the **"widespread assumption"**?
	1. Because it is true, the history of civil law is of as much interest to historians focusing on general social history as to those specializing in legal history.
	1. [O] Because it is inaccurate, the history of civil law in early modern England should enrich the general historical scholarship of that period
	1. It is based on inaccurate data about the propertied male elite of early modern England
	1. It does not provide a plausible explanation for historians' failure to study the civil law of early modern England
	1. It is based in an analogy with criminal law in early modern England

10. The passage suggests that the history of criminal law in early modern England differs from the history of civil law during that same period in that the history of criminal law
	1. is of more intellectual interest to historians and their readers
	1. [O] has been studied more thoroughly by historians
	1. is more relevant to general social history
	1. involves the study of a larger proportion of the population
	1. dose not require the mastery of an extremely formal system of procedures
