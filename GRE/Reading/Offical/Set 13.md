The most dramatic changes that took place during the seventeenth century in French culinary techniques concern **seasoning**. The **strong flavors** of the Middle Ages still had some adherents but **were increasingly rejected** in favor of sauces made with fat, which were thought to preserve more natural flavor. While spices still *figured* in about two-thirds of recipes, a proportion just as high as in the Middle Ages, they were used more sparingly. This statement is **difficult to prove** on the basis of cookbooks alone, because recipes were still imprecise. However, there are the reports of **French travelers, who complained of foreign cooking too spicy to eat**. Such complaints, which do **not appear until the mid-seventeenth century**, attest to a change of __sensibilities__.

1. According to the passage, during the seventeenth century the French increasingly developed a taste for
	1. foreign travel
	1. milder sauces
	1. sweet delicacies
	1. spicy recipes
	1. recipes from the Middle Ages

2. In the context in which it appears, "__sensibilities__" most nearly means
	1. eccentricities
	1. *susceptibilities*
	1. preferences
	1. *sensations*
	1. emotions

According to the prevailing view, Homo erectus, an ancestor of Homo sapiens, lacked the intellectual and technological sophistication to have achieved controlled use of fire; that had to wait for the emergence of H. sapiens 40,000 years ago. **However, recent evidence seriously undermines this view**. At two sites in Kenya, many small, __lens-shaped__ *patches* of *discolored* earth were uncovered along with bones and stone tools of H. erectus. Analysis showed that the patches, which, like the tools and bones, dated from 1.6 million years ago, were almost certainly the result of deliberately built fires, since those fires were evidently much hotter than typical naturally occurring bush fires. The size of the patches rules out lightning strikes, which could have explained the fires' high temperatures. Furthermore, the fires were fed by a mixture of grasses and woods that strongly suggests deliberately collected fuel. In addition, __many of H. erectus' tools were made of basalt or quartz__, stones which, when exposed to the intense heat near a campfire, form characteristic dimples on their surface. A recent study found that such dimples never appear on tools dating earlier than 1.6 million years ago but do consistently appear on later tools.

3. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. challenge an entrenched interpretation of certain well-known findings
	1. defend a widely held view from particular criticisms
	1. reconcile two competing interpretations of certain findings
	1. present evidence that calls a popular view into question
	1. point out the scientific implausibility of particular interpretations of certain findings

4. The temperature of the fires that produced the __"lens-shaped patches"__ is mentioned primarily in order to
	1. offer an explanation for the small size of the patches
	1. present evidence to support a hypothesis about the cause of those fires
	1. show how scientists determined the type of fuel that fed those fires
	1. present data that helped to ascertain the age of the patches
	1. acknowledge that certain characteristics of those fires present an unresolved contradiction.

5. The fact that "many of H. erectus' tools were made of basalt or quartz" is relevant to the argument of the passage for which of the following reasons?
	1. No tools made from these stones have been found in sites associated with H. sapiens.
	1. These stones must have been deliberately collected for tool use.
	1. These stones rarely appear in sites dating later than 40,000 years ago.
	1. The tools formed from these stones could not have been formed without the use of intense heat.
	1. These stones develop certain characteristics in response to high temperatures.

According to ancient records, the first sales tax that the government of Selea imposed was a tax of two centima coins on every jar of cooking oil sold in Selea. Tax records show that **despite a stable population, revenues from the oil tax declined steeply over the first two years** that the tax was in effect. Therefore, **a significant proportion of Seleans must have failed to pay taxes** on the cooking oil they purchased.

6. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument given?
	1. The penalty for failing to pay the tax on a jar of cooking oil was not significantly greater than the price of the jar of oil.
	1. Even with the tax, the total cost of a jar of cooking oil for a Selean household declined steadily in the years just before and just after the tax was instituted.
	1. During the first two years after the tax was in effect, Selean law required merchants to sell cooking oil in jars of the same size as before the tax was instituted.
	1. The amount of oil used for cooking by Selean households increased after the implementation of the tax.
	1. The proportion of Selean households that produced their own cooking oil increased significantly after the implementation of the tax.

Because different mammalian species favor different environments, identifying and counting bones from prehistoric deposits in caves can reveal much about climatic changes. **However, using large mammals' bones can be problematic.** Some species, such as __red deer__, are **very adaptable**-at home both on open grassland and in thick woodland. Moreover, some large-animal bones may have **traveled considerable distances** before being discarded: both carnivores and humans can have large hunting territories and bring home large animals quite unlike those near their den or campsite. Consequently, the bones of the **small mammals** found within cave sediments **provide a better index of climate change**: they are generally more numerous, the species are more sensitive to environmental conditions, and few travel far within their short lives.

7. __For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The passage mentions which of the following as an obstacle to using animal bones to reconstruct past climate changes?
	1. The size of some carnivorous species' hunting territories
	1. The range over which some small mammals travel
	1. The ability of some species to thrive in multiple types of environment

8. The passage mentions __"red deer"__ as an instance of an animal that
	1. is likely to be transported long distances by carnivores or humans
	1. is frequently represented in prehistoric bone deposits
	1. can be used to reconstruct past climate changes
	1. can travel considerable distances over the course of its life
	1. yields limited information about past environmental conditions

One way to determine which planets outside the solar system might harbor life is to look for *telltale* signs in their light. Living organisms create a chemical *disequilibrium* in their environment, typically indicated by a molecule whose presence can be explained only if some process is continually regenerating it. For example, __Earth's atmosphere contains oxygen__ because photosynthesis produces it faster than it is lost through processes such as the rusting of iron in rocks. **However, chemical disequilibrium does not necessarily indicate the presence of life** because, as in the case of methane on Mars, the imbalance could arise through nonbiological processes.

9. The passage mentions that __"Earth's atmosphere contains oxygen"__ primarily in order to
	1. contribute to a discussion of the nature of photosynthesis
	1. give an example of a chemical disequilibrium
	1. identify an element that scientists are looking for on Mars
	1. illustrate a process that occurs only on Earth
	1. introduce a contrast between oxygen and methane

10. __For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ According to the passage, which of the following about the presence of a chemical disequilibrium is true?
	1. It may indicate the presence of life.
	1. It may be the product of a nonbiological process.
	1. It is something that typically is short-lived.
