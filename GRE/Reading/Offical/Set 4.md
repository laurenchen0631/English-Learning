## Questions

Saturn's *E ring* consists of particles so small that they would be dispersed by solar radiation pressure in a few tens of thousands of years. That the ring exists today suggests, therefore, that it originated in the relatively recent past-but how? Researchers suggest that *Enceladus*, one of Saturn's moons, may be responsible. This icy moon has no craters, possibly because liquid water from its interior flowed across the surface in the relatively recent past, erasing all preexisting impact features. An impact into Enceladus within the past thousand years or so may have *blasted* liquid water into space. Water droplets would have frozen quickly into ice crystals, which may then have drifted through the Saturnian system and formed into the E ring.

1. Which of the following, if true, would challenge the hypothesis presented in the passage concerning Enceladus and Saturn's E ring?
	1. Enceladus is not the only moon orbiting Saturn.
	1. Enceladus s lack of craters is not due to ensure by water.
	1. No impact has occurred on Enceladus in the past few tens of thousands of years.

2. Select the sentence that points out the *significance* of the fact that the particles that make up Saturn‘s E ring are susceptible to dispersion.
	1. Saturn' E ring .... years.
	1. [O] That the ring exists .. but how?
	1. Researchers suggest ...  be responsible
	1. This icy moon .. impact features.
	1. An impact into .. water into space
	1. Water droplets .. formed into the E ring.

Since the 1970s, archaeological sites in China's Yangtze River region have yielded evidence of sophisticated rice-farming societies that predate signs of rice cultivation elsewhere in East Asia by a thousand years. Before this evidence was discovered, it had generally been assumed that rice farming began farther to the south. This scenario was based both on the geographic range of wild or free-living rice, which was not thought to extend as far north as the Yangtze, and on archaeological records of very early domestic rice from Southeast Asia and India (now known to be not so old as first reported). Proponents of the __southern-origin theory__ point out that early rice-farming societies along the Yangtze were already highly developed and that evidence for the first stage of rice cultivation is missing. They argue that the first hunter-gatherers to develop rice agriculture must have done so in this southern zone, within the apparent present-day geographic range of wild rice.

Yet while most stands of wild rice reported in a 1984 survey were concentrated to the south of the Yangtze *drainage*, two northern *outlier* populations were also discovered in provinces along the middle and lower Yangtze, evidence that the Yangtze wetland may fall within both the present-day and the historical geographic ranges of rice's wild ancestor.

3. Which of the following, if true, would most clearly undermine the conclusion that the author makes based on the 1984 survey?
	1. Areas south of the Yangtze basin currently have less wild-rice habitat than they once did
	1. Survey since 1984 have shown wild rice populations along the upper Yangtze as well as along the middle and lower Yangtze
	1. The populations of wild rice along the Yangtze represent strains of wild rice that migrated to the north relatively recently.
	1. Early rice-farming societies along the Yangtze were not as highly developed as archaeologists once thought.
	1. In East Asia, the historical geographic range of wild rice was more extensive than the present-day geographic range is.

4. Based on the passage, skeptics of the idea that rice cultivation began in the Yangtze River region can point to which of the following for support?
	1. Lack of evidence supporting the existence of rice-farming societies along the Yangtze at an early date
	1. Lack of evidence regarding the initial stages of rice cultivation in the Yangtze region
	1. Recent discoveries pertaining to the historical geographic range of rice‘s wild ancestor
	1. New information regarding the dates of very early domestic rice from Southeast Asia
	1. New theories pertaining to how hunter-gatherers first developed rice agriculture in East Asia

5. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about the __"southern-origin theory"__?
	1. The theory is based on an unconventional understanding of how hunter-gatherers first developed rice agriculture
	1. The theory fails to take into account the apparent fact that evidence for the first stage of rice cultivation in the north is missing.
	1. The theory was developed primarily in response to a 1984 survey of wild rice‘s geographic range
	1. Reassessment of the dates of some archaeological evidence has undermined support for the theory.
	1. Evidence of sophisticated rice-farming societies in the Yangtze region provides support for the theory

Upon maturity, monarch butterflies travel hundreds of miles from their places of origin and lay their eggs on milkweed. The caterpillars that emerge feed on milkweed and absorb the *glycosides* in milkweed *sap*. The specific glycosides present in milkweed differ from region to region within the monarch butterfly's range. Mature butterflies retain the glycosides they absorb as caterpillars. Clearly, therefore, **the glycosides in a mature monarch butterfly could be used to determine its place of origin.**

6. Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
	1. [O] Mature monarch butterflies do not feed on parts of milkweed that contain glycosides.
	1. The glycosides in milkweed sap slightly toxic to caterpillars of other species.
	1. The vast majority of the monarch butterflies that are laying eggs in a given region will have traveled there from a single region.
	1. There are substances other than glycosides in milkweed sap that accumulate in a monarch caterpillar and are retained in the body of the mature butterfly.
	1. There are certain glycosides that are found in the sap of all milkweeds, no matter where they grow within the monarch butterfly‘s range

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the prevailing aesthetic views among artists in the United States were shaped by the harsh economic realities of the period, when millions of Americans found themselves unemployed or *dispossessed* Not surprisingly, most artists of this period chose to work in socially oriented styles. However, while the Regionalists-led by Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, and John Steuart Curry-embraced a *rightist*, *isolationist* ideology, *recoiling* from the present and seeking to recapture in their paintings America‘s agrarian past, the Social Realists-among them William Gropper and Ben Shahn-depicted the condition of workers engaged in a class struggle, both groups built upon **earlier traditions** in American painting that now assumed a new urgency.

7. According to the passage, which of the following was true of both the Regionalists and the Social Realists during the 1930s?
	1. They sought to recapture a less troubled period in America‘s history.
	1. They developed artistic traditions that were already in existence.
	1. Their paintings were deeply affected by the economic hardships of the period.

8. It can be inferred from the passage that the Regionalists and the Social Realists differed in which of the following ways?
	1. The Regionalists were primarily concerned with depicting actual events in history, while the Social Realist were primarily concerned with portraying an idealized future
	1. The Regionalists were primarily concerned with the economic ramifications of the Depression, while the Social Realists were primarily concerned with its social ramifications.
	1. The Regionalists lacked a sense of urgency, while the Social Realists pressed for change
	1. [?] The Regionalists tended to romanticize the past, while the Social Realists depicted the past in harsh terms.
	1. [O] The political outlook of the Regionalists tended to be more **conservative** than that of the Social Realists.

Published in 1829, David Walker‘s Appeal delivered a furious indictment of American slavery and racism while articulating the necessity of resisting immoral authority by any means necessary. The significance of Walker‘s pamphlet is not limited to this ideological message, however. Walker believed that the *disparity* between the condition of Black Americans and the "*unalienable* rights" and republican principles laid out in *the Declaration of Independence* could be a *rallying point* for Black Americans seeking to be recognized as citizens. Like Thomas Paine, whose 1776 pamphlet Common Sense helped propel the American colonies toward independence, Walker recognized the importance of claiming a public voice through which to communicate with both Black and White Americans, and the utility of using printed documents to do so.

9. The passage indicates that Walker would probably have agreed with which of the following about the Declaration of Independence?
	1. It presents political ideals that the United States had not lived up to.
	1. It could play a useful role in engendering social progress.
	1. It is often misinterpreted by its most zealous admirers.

10. The passage suggests that Walker would have agrees with which of the following about resistance to immoral authority?
	1. [O] The written word offered one effective aid to such resistance
	1. [O] Such resistance should not be limited to spoken and written expressions of dissent.
	1. [O] Such resistance was crucial if Black Americans were to achieve their full rights as citizens.
