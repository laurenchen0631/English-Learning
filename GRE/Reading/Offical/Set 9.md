## Questions

According to von Kármán, *a **scientist** seeks to understand what is; an **engineer**, to create what never was.* **But** dichotomies are seldom clear-cut. *When a scientist proposes a truly new hypothesis about, say, the origin of the universe, prior to its articulation by that scientist, that hypothesis "never was."* Einstein, certainly a *prototypical* scientist, took that view, criticizing physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach for having "thought that somehow theories arise by means of discovery rather than invention." Science historian Thomas P. Hughes notes that **to Einstein, invention was the manipulation not only of things but also of concepts.** Einstein believed that an artifact was a materialized concept and that a *hard-and-fast* line between technology and science simply did not exist.

1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. suggest that a certain term is often misunderstood
	1. [O] question the basis for a particular distinction
	1. show how one field has been influenced by another
	1. argue that one view of a dichotomy has changed over time
	1. examine the origins of a scientific theory

2. The author of the passage mentions Mach most likely in order to
	1. provide a contrast that illuminates Einstein's view
	1. identify an inspiration for von Kármán's views
	1. show how perspectives on the nature of invention have changed over time
	1. show how Einstein's view of Mach influenced other scientists' views about invention
	1. illustrate Einstein's and Mach's opposing views about the value of technology

In the late nineteenth century, art critics regarded seventeenth-century Dutch paintings as direct reflections of reality. The paintings were discussed as an index of the democracy of a society that chose to represent its class, action, and occupations exactly as they were, wide-ranging realism was seen as the great accomplishment of Dutch art. However, the achievement of more **recent study** of Dutch art has been the recovery of the fact that **such paintings are to be taken as symbolizing mortality**, the renaissance of earthly life, and the power of God, and as message that range from the mildly moralizing to the firmly didactic. How explicit and consistent the symbolizing process was intended to be is a much *thornier* matter, but anyone who has more familiarity than a passing acquaintance with Dutch literature or with the kinds of images used in illustrated books (above all emblem books) will know how *much less* pervasive was the habit of investing ordinary objects than of investing scenes with meaning that go beyond their surface and outward appearance. In the mid-1960s, Eddy de Jongh published an extraordinary array of material-especially from the emblem books and *vernacular* literature-that confirmed the unreliability of taking Dutch pictures at surface value alone.

The major difficulty, however, with the findings of critics such as de Jongh is that it is **not easy to assess the multiplicity of levels** in which Dutch viewers interpreted these pictures. De Jongh's followers typically regard the pictures as purely symbolic. **Not every object within Dutch paintings need be interpreted** in terms of the *gloss* given to its equivalent representation in the emblem books. Not every foot warmer is to be interpreted in terms of the foot warmer in Rowmer Visscher's Sinnepoppen of 1614, __not every bridle is an emblem of restraint__ (though many were indeed just that).

To maintain as Brown does, that the two children in Netscher's painting A Lady Teaching a Child to Read stand for industry and idleness is to **fail to understand that the painting has a variety of possible meanings**, even though the picture undoubtedly carriers unmistakable symbolic meanings, too. *Modern Art historians may well find the discovery of parallels between a painting and a specific emblem exciting, they may, like seventeenth-century viewers, search for the double that lie behind many paintings.* But seventeenth-century response can hardly be reduced to the level of formula. To suggest otherwise is to imply a laboriousness of mental process that may well characterize modern interpretations of seventeenth-century Dutch Art, but that was, for the most part, not characteristic in the seventeenth century.

3. The passage is primarily concerned with which of the following?
	1. Reconciling two different points of view about how art reflects
	1. Criticizing a traditional method of interpretation
	1. Tracing the development of an innovative scholarly approach
	1. Describing and evaluating a recent critical approach
	1. Describing a long-standing controversy and how it was resolved

4. The author of the passage mentions bridles in the __highlighted portion__ of the passage most likely in order to
	1. Suggest that restraint was only one of the many symbolic meanings attached to bridles
	1. Provide an example of an everyday, physical object that was not endowed with symbolic meaning
	1. Provide an example of an object that modern critics have endowed with symbolic meaning different from the meaning assigned it by seventeenth-century Dutch artists
	1. Provide an example of an object with symbolic meaning that was not always used as a symbol
	1. Provide an example of an everyday object that appears in a significant number of seventeenth century Dutch paintings

5. Which of the following best describes the function of the last paragraph of the passage?
	1. It provides specific applications of the critical approach introduced in the preceding paragraph
	1. It presents a *caveat* about the critical approach discussed in the preceding paragraph
	1. It presents the research on which a theory presented in the preceding paragraph is based
	1. It refutes a theory presented in the preceding paragraph and advocates a return to a more traditional approach
	1. It provides further information about the unusual phenomenon described in the preceding paragraph

6. The passage suggests which of the following **about emblem books** in seventeenth-century Holland?
	1. They confirm that seventeenth century Dutch painting depict some objects and scenes rarely found in daily life.
	1. They are more useful than vernacular literature in providing information about the symbolic content of seventeenth-century Dutch painting.
	1. They have been misinterpreted by art critics, such as de Jongh, who claim seventeenth-century Dutch paintings contain symbolic meaning
	1. They are not useful in interpreting seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painting.
	1. [O] They contain material that challenges the assumptions of the nineteenth-century critics about seventeenth-century Dutch painting.

Compared with doctors who see patients only in their offices, doctors who see their patients in the patients' homes develop a more personal relationship with them. Their patients are also less likely to bring *malpractice* *suits* against them. **This lower rate of malpractice suits clearly supports the common belief that having a close relationship with a doctor increases a patient's willingness** to *give* that doctor *the benefit of the doubt* when difficulties arise.

7. Which of the following, if true of doctors who make house calls, most seriously weakens **the argument**?
	1. They are more likely than are doctors who do not make house calls to believe that a doctor's *bedside* manner is an important part of medical treatment.
	1. [O] They see their patients more frequently than do doctors who do not make house calls and so acquire more information about the patients' conditions.
	1. They tend to have fewer years of experience at practicing medicine than do doctors who do not make house calls.
	1. They perform all the same types of treatment as doctors who do not make house calls.
	1. They are not charged any less for malpractice insurance than are doctors who do not make house calls.

Following the United States Civil War (1861–1865), many former slaves in the rural South became *sharecroppers* (raising a landlord's crop for a share of the profits) or tenant farmers (selling what they raised and paying a share of the profits as rent). **Most historians tend to depict these African Americans as victims of racism and the farm tenancy system.** This approach, **however**, overlooks the role played by such African American rural reformers as Robert Lloyd Smith, founder of the Farmers' Improvement Society of Texas, and Joseph Elward Clayton, the first African American to organize farmers' institutes for the Texas Department of Agriculture. Both men advocated comfortable homes and better schools for African Americans; both attributed poverty and illiteracy to causes other than racism, such as insect damage to crops; and both worked to keep Black farmers on the land, although Smith opposed farm tenancy. Both were also accused by their contemporaries of downplaying the devastating impact of the farm tenancy system on Black farmers and of accommodating racism. While the extent of these reformers' influence requires more study, clearly **their organizations provided a voice for African American farmers seeking to improve their positions in the agrarian South.**

8. The passage is primarily concerned with
	1. restoring the reputations of two reformers whose accomplishments have long been denigrated by historians
	1. refuting criticisms of two reformers made by their contemporaries by demonstrating that those criticisms are baseless
	1. [O] providing evidence to support a claim that historians' understanding of a particular phenomenon may be incomplete
	1. discussing some of the reasons that two reformers who were well-known during their lifetimes are considered by historians today to have been ineffective
	1. suggesting an alternative interpretation of the effect of the farm tenancy system **on the economy** of the rural South following the Civil War

9. Select the sentence that identifies a **prevailing scholarly view**.

10. The author of the passage would most likely agree with which of the following statements concerning Smith and Clayton?
	1. More research is required to determine whether or not their organizations were typical of those established to aid African American farmers in the post–Civil War rural South.
	1. Their contributions to the improvement of the living conditions of African American farmers were overshadowed by subsequent political controversy.
	1. Their achievements as reformers have been exaggerated by many historians of the post–Civil War period.
	1. There is evidence demonstrating that they were committed to aiding African American farmers in the rural South.
	1. The extent of the criticisms made about them by their contemporaries is difficult to determine.

## Review
1. 文章首先介绍K的关于科学家和工程师严格区分的观点。二句but句是作者对K的反驳，作者认为两者之间没有严格区别。作者引用爱因斯坦支持自己的观点：爱因斯坦对Ernst Mach的批评，以及历史学家Hughs对爱因斯坦观点的概括。
