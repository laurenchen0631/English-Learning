## Questions

Many scholars view the 1892 arrival of the *boll weevil*, a destructive agricultural pest, as a drastic shock to the economic routine of the cotton-dependent American South, and as one **trigger of the Great Migration of African Americans to the North** in search of employment opportunities. However, **Higgs argues** that such accounts exaggerate the insect's impact on the southern cotton industry specifically and on the southern economy as a whole. His fundamental point is that the reductions in supply caused by the weevil led to offsetting increases in prices paid to cotton farmers. **In Higgs's view the boll weevil infestation was neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition underlying the Great Migration.** And as Giesen observed, the **South produced more cotton in 1921 than in 1892.**

1. The passage is primarily concerned with
	1. predicting an outcome
	1. chronicling a change
	1. attributing a cause
	1. describing an alternative viewpoint
	1. reconciling competing positions

2. Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the view held by Higgs?
	1. Cotton could not be supplanted by other crops in the South in the years immediately following 1892.
	1. The proportion of the southern African American population employed by the cotton industry remained steady in the period from 1892 to 1921.
	1. The impact of the boll weevil on the southern cotton crop was exacerbated by poor weather conditions in the years 1892 to 1921.
	1. Cotton-producing areas outside the American South escaped the ravages of the boll weevil until 1921.
	1. The number of African Americans who moved to the North as part of the Great Migration peaked in 1910.

One way to assess This is the American Earth, a collection of photographs selected and arranged by **Nancy Newhall**, is to **apply Newhall's own criteria for judging photographic art**. **Does this photographic essay achieve results impossible in other media?** By contrasting the small with the vast-for example, placing a photo of a rock pool next to one of a spiral galaxy-Newhall exploits the camera's ability to manipulate the size of an object, thereby challenging viewers to question their conventional concepts of size. **However, a similar result could be achieved in the medium of painting.** **Does the work bear its creator's *imprint***, and **does it draw viewers' interest even after repeated viewings, Newhall's second and third criteria**? Indeed, Newhall's work bears her unmistakable imprint in the juxtaposition of the photos and in the rhythmic prose accompanying them, but the **individual viewer must decide whether Newhall's work evokes, as it did for this reviewer, new experiences** upon subsequent viewings.

3. The author of the passage is primarily concerned with doing which of the following?
	1. Defending a particular set of criteria for evaluating a work of art
	1. [O] Applying a particular set of criteria to a work of art
	1. Describing the most significant aspects of a work of art
	1. Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of a work of art
	1. Reevaluating the significance of a work of art

4. According to the passage, which of the following is a way in which **This is the American Earth satisfies Newhall's criteria** for judging photographic art?
	1. It takes advantage of one of the camera's unique abilities.
	1. It leaves viewers with a particularly strong visual impression.
	1. It contains elements identifying it as a particular person's work.
	1. It consistently evokes an emotional response from viewers.
	1. It successfully destroys an overemphasis on humans' concept of size.

5. It can be inferred that the author of the passage would most likely agree with which of the following statements about applying Newhall's criteria to This is the American Earth ?
	1. Newhall's second criterion is most important when judging this kind of photographic art.
	1. Newhall's first criterion is the most subjective when judging this kind of photographic art.
	1. Newhall's criteria are not particularly useful for judging this kind of photographic art.
	1. The collection fails to satisfy one of Newhall's basic criteria for judging photographic art.
	1. The collection illustrates why it is difficult to apply a standard set of criteria to a particular work of art.

In mountainous regions, the timberline is the highest altitude at which trees grow. In the Rocky Mountains, the current timberline is at the altitude above which growing season temperatures remain cooler than 10 degrees centigrade. **Fossilized remains of trees that grew 10,000 years ago have been found 100 meters above** the current Rocky Mountain timberline. Clearly, **therefore, the climate of the Rocky Mountains is cooler now** than it was 10,000 years ago.

6. Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies?
	1. In the past 10,000 years, the only trees to have grown above today's timberline are the trees whose fossilized remains been found.
	1. No trees grew 10,000 years ago at altitudes higher than the ones at which fossilized tree remains have been found.
	1. The fossils are not of species of trees that were able to tolerate cooler growing temperatures than are the species that currently grow near the timberline.
	1. The Rocky Mountains have not eroded significantly over the past 10,000 years.
	1. The climate of the Rocky Mountains has never been significantly warmer than during the lifetime of the trees whose fossilized remains have been found.

A 2004 scientific drilling expedition in the Arctic found an abundance of Azolla fern spores in samples of 50-million-year-old material from the seafloor. Because the Azolla fern can grow only in freshwater, __some scientists__ believe the spores originated in river deltas or lagoons and drifted into the Arctic Ocean. **However, Brinkhuis believes that the fern grew in a *once-verdant* ocean**. The sheer abundance of the spores makes it unlikely, by some accounts, that they would have originated elsewhere. It is possible that __geologic forces__ at one point **closed the straits connecting other oceans to the Arctic Ocean**, so water from rivers feeding into it pooled and formed a surface layer of freshwater where the fern could survive. **A later opening of the straits would have wiped out the fern.**

7. **For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ With which of the following statements about Azolla fern spores would the scientists mentioned in the second sentence be likely to agree?
	1. The Azolla fern spores found in 50-million-year-old material originated in rivers or lagoons.
	1. Discharge from rivers created an environment that impeded the release of Azolla fern spores in the Arctic Ocean.
	1. The large quantity of Azolla fern spores present in the materials underlying the Arctic Ocean indicates that the ocean was once an ideal environment for the growth of these ferns.

8. The passage's reference to __"geologic forces"__ serves to indicate a mechanism by which
	1. [?] rivers might have deposited large numbers of fern spores in the Arctic Ocean
	1. [?] freshwater lagoons might have formed close to the Arctic Ocean
	1. the temperature of the Arctic Ocean might have risen
	1. water from other oceans might have become mixed with that of the Arctic Ocean
	1. [O] the Arctic Ocean might have become a suitable environment for ferns to grow in

While the golden age of English caricature (circa 1760–1820) is well documented, **contemporaneous French caricature has been largely ignored**, perhaps partly due to the artists' *anonymity*. Prominent London caricaturists were recognized as artists and political commentators by their contemporaries. French caricatures, however, were often unsigned and few archival resources provide information about those caricaturists whose names are known. **Records of the publishers of French caricature have survived more often than those of the artists.** Unlike in London, where publishers competed to work with celebrated caricaturists, **publishers in Paris played a more prominent role in caricature production than artists and artisans.** The names of publishers rather than artists often appear on the prints, perhaps in part **because prints were often the work of several artisans.**

9. The passage suggests that which of the following is true of English caricatures but not of French caricatures?
	1. They were often the product of collaboration between artists and publishers.
	1. They were primarily intended to appeal to an elite audience.
	1. They were designed to convey commentary on political issues of the day.
	1. They were intended primarily for a domestic rather than a foreign audience.
	1. They were likely regarded by contemporaries as expressing an individual artist`s views.

10. __For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply__. The passage suggests which of the following as a reason why French caricature has been relatively neglected compared to English caricature?
	1. [O] French caricatures were often left unsigned.
	1. [O] French caricaturists had less *prestige* than did English caricaturists.
	1. English caricatures have been better preserved than have French caricatures.

## Review
4. 细节题
	1. 原文 a similar result could be achieved in the medium of painting 否決此選項
	3. 原文中提到 Indeed, Newhall's work bears her unmistakable imprint 應此該作品確實 Nancy Newhall 的第二標準 Does the work bear its creator's imprint
	4. 原文 the individual viewer must decide whether Newhall's work evokes new experiences 沒有正面回答此問題

6. 邏輯加強提
	3. timberline上100公尺有 10,000 年前的植物化石 --> 所以代表(以前timberline更高)近年的氣溫較10,000年前低(因為近年的timberline無法活在更高的地方)

8. 细节题
	1. 原文 water from rivers feeding into it pooled and formed a surface layer of freshwater where the fern could survive，而不是由 rivers 把 fern spores 帶進來的
	2. 文中提到了 connecting other oceans to the Arctic Ocean 可見應該不是在 the Arctic Ocean 旁形成 lagoon

10. 细节题
	2. 從 few archival resources provide information about those caricaturists whose names are known 得知
