## Questions
In 1909, based on his knowledge of the densities that whitetail deer could reach and of the size of their range, Seton estimated *precolonial* North America's whitetail population at 20 million. **More recent estimates have been made** using more sophisticated techniques. In addition to using better computing techniques, these estimates used Native American population sizes, as well as the numbers of animals Native Americans needed over the course of the year for their survival. Assuming that their hunting was sustainable (which is reasonable, given __how long Native Americans had been hunting deer__), this gives a minimum size for the population. Together with a better understanding of the whitetails' range, these new estimates point to whitetail populations in the region of 23.6–32.8 million animals.

1. The author mentions __the length of time Native Americans had been hunting deer__ primarily in order to
	1. support a particular line of reasoning
	1. **challenge** the relevance of certain data
	1. **contrast** two methods for arriving at a population estimate
	1. **account for a change** in population size
	1. note a factor about which researchers **cannot be certain**

2. The passage suggests which of the following about Seton's estimate of the precolonial whitetail deer population in North America?
	1. It **proposed a possible minimum** but not a possible maximum population for whitetail deer.
	1. It was based on an understanding of the whitetails' range that was less accurate than the one informing more recent estimates.
	1. It **challenged previous assumptions** about the densities that whitetail deer could sustain over long periods.
	1. It **established new methods** of estimating the size of animal populations that were adopted by later researchers.
	1. It turned out to be fairly accurate despite being partly based on inaccurate assumptions about Native American hunting practices.

**Jane Austen's relationship to Romanticism** has long been a vexed one. Although her dates (1775–1817) place her squarely within the period, she traditionally has been studied apart from the male poets whose work defined British Romanticism for most of the twentieth century. In the past her novels were thought to **follow an Augustan mode at odds with the Romantic ethos.** Even with the advent of historicist and feminist criticism, which challenged many previous characterizations of **Austen as detached from the major social, political, and aesthetic currents of her time,** she continued to be distinguished from her male contemporaries. Jerome McGann, for example, insists that Austen does not espouse the Romantic ideology. Anne Mellor declares that Austen, along with other "leading women intellectuals and writers of the day," "did not" participate in the Romantic "spirit of the age" but instead embraced an alternative ideology that Mellor labels __"feminine Romanticism."__

__To be sure, some critics throughout the years have argued for Austen's affinities with one or more of the male Romantic poets.__ A special issue of the Wordsworth Circle (Autumn 1976) was devoted to exploring connections between Austen and her male contemporaries. **Clifford Siskin** in his historicist study of Romanticism **argued that Austen does participate in the same major innovation, the *naturalization* of belief in a developing self, as characterizes Wordsworth's poetry and other key works from the period.** Recently, three books have appeared (by Clara Tuite, William Galperin, and William Deresiewicz) that in various ways treat Austen as a Romantic writer and together signal a shift in the tendency to segregate the major novelist of the age from the major poets.

The __present essay__ seeks to contribute to this goal of firmly integrating Austen within the Romantic movement and canon. It does so by pointing out affinities between Austen and a writer with whom she has not commonly been associated: John Keats. Most comparisons of Austen and the Romantic poets have focused on Wordsworth and Byron, whose works we know she read. Although Austen could not have read Keats's poems, which only began to appear in print during the last years of her life, and there is no evidence that Keats knew Austen's novels, a number of important similarities can be noted in these writers' works that provide further evidence to link Austen with the Romantic movement, especially the period of second-generation Romanticism when all of her novels were published.

3. According to the passage, compared to critics trained in __"historicist and feminist criticism,"__ **earlier critics of Austen were**
	1. more likely to represent her as isolated from the major intellectual currents of her period
	1. more likely to represent her as departing from Augustan modes of thought
	1. more likely to find connections between her novels and Romantic poetry
	1. less likely to neglect the influence of Romantic ideology on her work
	1. less likely to notice affinities between Austen and her female counterparts

4. According to the passage, the __"present essay"__ parallels **Siskin's study** in which of the following ways?
	1. It **aims to challenge** Austen's position in the Romantic movement by showing connections between Austen and an Augustan poet.
	1. It aims to situate Austen within the Romantic movement by studying connections **between Austen and a Romantic male novelist.**
	1. It aims to characterize Austen as a **second-generation** Romantic writer by showing how Austen participated in the naturalization of belief in a developing self.
	1. It aims to situate Austen within the Romantic movement by studying connections **between Austen's writings and those of a Romantic poet.**
	1. It aims to break new ground in Austen studies by studying the influence on Austen's work of a **second-generation** Romantic writer.

5. __For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The author of the passage would most likely agree with which of the following statements about the concept of __"feminine Romanticism"__?
	1. It does little to *alleviate* Austen's vexed relationship to Romanticism.
	1. It segregates her from male writers whose poetry is central to the Romantic period.
	1. It implies that Austen eventually embraced the Romantic ideology.

6. Which of the following best describes the function of the __highlighted sentence__ in the context of the passage as a whole?
	1. It emphasizes the widespread interest in connections between Austen and the Romantic poets.
	1. It concedes a methodological limitation in the prevailing approach to characterizing Austen`s relationship to Romanticism.
	1. It reconciles contrasting views about Austen`s relationship to Romanticism.
	1. [?] It questions the validity of the claims made in the previous paragraph.
	1. [O] It acknowledges some exceptions to the critical trend described in the first paragraph.

In Bronze Age farm fields near the ancient circle of stones at Stonehenge, the furrows were found plowed at right angles to an imaginary line to the place where the Sun rises on the shortest day of the year. Some of the major stones at Stonehenge are also aligned, apparently intentionally, with that point on the horizon. Since **these fields date from shortly after Stonehenge was completed**, **the plowing was probably consciously guided according to systematic observation of the Sun`s position.**

7. Which of the following, if true, most **strengthens** the argument?
	1. [O] The landscape in which these fields were situated made it more difficult to plow in the direction in which the furrows were plowed than in other directions.
	1. The direction of the plowing on any other Bronze Age farm fields near Stonehenge cannot be determined because of the deep plowing that has taken place in modern times.
	1. Bronze Age farmers had primitive plows that were not capable of turning over soils heavier than those in the fields near Stonehenge.
	1. The Bronze Age farm fields near Stonehenge were laid out in clusters that were not immediately next to other such clusters.
	1. Even before Stonehenge was built, farmers in the area could have made a practice of observing the Sun`s position at various times of year.

**The gap between crime and punishment** in preindustrial England has long puzzled historians. Although most criminal trials involved **felonies for which the penalty was execution**, relatively few convicted criminals were actually executed. **This distance between potential and actual applications of the law** was traditionally thought to demonstrate the inefficiency of premodern legal systems: historians assumed that before the late eighteenth century, the "success" rates of courts were minimal because the legal system had to function without a modern legal bureaucracy.

Recently, however, the history of legal development has been seen as something other than an increasing administrative ability to apply sentences. Acknowledging, as their predecessors had not, that law enforcement must be understood within a historically specific social context, recent scholars have suggested that, **in a non-democratic society, selective enforcement was a valuable tool of class power**: a *discretionary* legal system enabled the ruling classes to maintain social control by exercising a *paternalistic* power to grant or to deny mercy as they wished.

8. According to the passage, which of the following was true of felonies in preindustrial England?
	1. They were the only type of crime routinely punished by execution.
	1. They were the only type of crime with regard to which discretionary sentencing was practiced.
	1. They were the type of crime in response to which an unwieldy bureaucracy became necessary.
	1. They were the type of crime most often granted clemency.
	1. [O] They were the type of crime that accounted for most criminal trials.

9. The main historical question discussed in the passage is the reason for the gap between
	1. felony laws in contemporary society and felony laws in preindustrial England
	1. eighteenth-century legal scholarship and modern legal practices
	1. premodern methods of social control and contemporary methods of social control
	1. crimes whose sentences were routinely enforced and crimes for which clemency was routinely granted
	1. sentences that the courts were able to impose by law and sentences actually carried out

10. It can be inferred from the passage that the author considers which of the following to be a *salient* characteristic of modern legal systems?
	1. A hesitance on the part of law enforcement officials to seek execution for felons
	1. A tendency initially to seek severe sentences for felons, but then to accept more lenient sentences later
	1. A tendency to interpret laws within the social contexts that give rise to them
	1. An administrative system that enables the legal system to enforce sentencing
	1. A bureaucracy that discriminates against certain criminals by arbitrarily granting or denying leniency
