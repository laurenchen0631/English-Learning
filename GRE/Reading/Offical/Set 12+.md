## Questions

San Lorenzo, center of the ancient Mesoamerican *Olmec* culture, is famous for its massive stone statuary and distinctive ceramic figurines. Archaeologists disagree, however, about **why Olmec-style ceramics have also been found at sites very distant from the Olmec heartland**. Proponents of the mother-culture interpretation point to the statuary as *indicative* of unprecedented social organization and interpret the distribution of the ceramics as evidence of Olmec influence on less complex societies. According to the sister-cultures interpretation, however, these Olmec-style objects are simply a visual expression of religious beliefs shared by numerous Mesoamerican cultures whose contact with one another increased over time. The Olmec were neither solely responsible for the creation and spread of the style nor more advanced than the cultures they contacted.

1. It can be inferred that proponents of the sister-culture interpretation would be LEAST likely to agree with proponents of the mother-culture interpretation on which of the following issues?
	1. The importance of religion in Olmec society
	1. The degree of contact between San Lorenzo and other Mesoamerican cultures
	1. The place where Olmec-style objects discovered far from San Lorenzo were produced
	1. [O] The relative contribution the center of the Olmec culture made to the Olmec style of ceramics
	1. The level of social organization needed to produce the Olmec stone statuary in San Lorenzo

2. Which of the following discoveries would provide evidence favoring either one or the other of the two interpretations?
	1. The discovery that a high proportion of the Olmec-style pottery found in San Lorenzo was made in settlements outside the Olmec heartland.
	1. The discovery that while many settlements outside the Olmec heartland had ceramics that had been made in San Lorenzo, none had ceramics that had been made in other such settlements.
	1. The discovery that one particular style of Olmec-style ceramic was found in a number of settlements outside the Olmec heartland but not in San Lorenzo.

Observations of social play in several species of mammals indicate that individuals often depart from the usual social conventions by, for example, alternating dominant and subordinate positions in **ways that do not occur outside the play context.** Some researchers have even suggested that individuals must follow a 50:50 rule during *dyadic* play (play between two individuals), so that each participant wins an equal proportion of play encounters. Commonly cited cooperative tactics used to equalize play include *self-handicapping* (participants make themselves more vulnerable to attacks by their opponents) and *role reversal* (individuals that are dominant in the nonplay context appear subordinate during play). Where such tactics occur among unevenly matched opponents, they appear to **facilitate play by making play more appealing to the less advantaged player.**

When Bauer and Smuts set out to study play behavior in domestic dogs, they made several predictions. They expected to find no significant sex differences in dogs play behavior. The motor skills dogs use in play fighting parallel those used in nonplayful aggression and hunting, areas in which dogs behavior is relatively undifferentiated by sex. They also predicted that the advantages *imparted* by larger relative size, by the experience of age, and by higher dominance status would affect dogs dyadic play. __Existing research__ on a variety of animal species suggests that individuals with such advantages often refrain from attacks and pursuits or engage in self-handicapping so as not to intimidate their play partners. __If this held true for dogs, larger, older, more dominant dogs would show more self-handicapping than their partners.__ But Bauer and Smuts predicted instead that dogs would deviate from the hypothetical 50:50 rule, with advantaged individuals retaining their positions by performing the majority of attacks and pursuits and engaging in fewer self-handicapping behaviors than their partners, thus reinforcing existing hierarchies.

Bauer and Smuts three-year study of dogs dyadic play found that most dyads showed some degree of asymmetry (one dog winning more encounters than the other) and some dyads showed complete asymmetry. They also found that in general, **older dogs performed more attacks and pursuits and that younger dogs engaged in more self-handicapping. Role reversal between dominant and subordinate individuals varied widely:** several dyads never reversed dominance roles, a few reversed them frequently, and most reversed them occasionally.

Bauer and Smuts finding about asymmetry in dyadic play has several implications. First, it indicates that active self-handicapping and role reversals are not necessarily required for play to occur. Indeed, play often continued at length even when one partner always won. Second, since frequent role reversals occurred, it appears that normal status asymmetries are often significantly more relaxed in the play context. **This suggests that role reversals, while not always necessary, probably do facilitate play.**

	1. contrast two different but closely related animal behaviors
	1. [O] present the findings of a particular study of animal behavior
	1. account for a particular behavior observed in mammals
	1. question the evidence used to support a hypothesis about a particular animal behavior

	1. Larger, more experienced animals generally maintain their hierarchical roles in relation to smaller, younger animals during dyadic play.
	1. Few animal species that engage in dyadic play adhere closely to the 50:50 rule during play encounters.
	1. Some animal species show much more asymmetry during dyadic play than other species do.

5. Which of the following best describes the purpose of the highlighted sentence?
	1. It cites certain factors that Bauer and Smuts predicted would account for dogs' deviation from the 50:50 rule.
	1. It identifies certain expectations that Bauer and Smuts had at the beginning of their study of dogs' dyadic play.

	1. The play behavior of most dogs remained constant from one encounter to another, regardless of the age of the play partner.
	2. A dog's play tactics were determined more by its partner's size and age than by its own size and age.
	3. Play among unevenly matched partners generally did not conform to the 50:50 rule postulated by some previous researchers.
	4. Older dogs almost never engaged in self-handicapping when playing with younger dogs.
	5. Most dogs engaged in dyadic play did not deviate from the roles of dominance and subordination that governed their behavior outside the play context.

Last year, Fillmore County's farmers used Sordane, a highly effective nonpersistent pesticide, on their crops. Though crop yields were satisfactory, aerial spraying of Sordane increased the county's incidence of respiratory illness. This year, farmers sprayed with the weaker pesticide Kaskanine instead. Crop yields were unchanged, while the county experienced a significant decline in respiratory illness. Therefore, **if farmers use only Kaskanine next year, the reduced incidence of respiratory illness will be maintained without sacrificing crop yields.**

7. Which of the following would it be **most useful to establish in order to evaluate the argument**?
	1. Whether Sordane is the most effective pesticide available to farmers in Fillmore County
	1. [O] Whether, as a result of last year's spraying of Sordane, this year's population of harmful insects was smaller than it would have been in a year following one in which farmers used only Kaskanine
	1. Whether the increase in the incidence of respiratory illness in Fillmore County caused by aerial spraying of Sordane was the only consideration in the farmers' decision to switch to Kaskanine
	1. Whether the use of Sordane has been discontinued in other counties for the same reasons as in Fillmore County
	1. Whether restrictions on the use of Sordane could have produced a significant reduction in the incidence of respiratory illness

Among some Native American peoples, the oral tradition of one group has sometimes influenced that of another; indeed, **tracing such influence has been one major task** of scholars of Native American oral literature. European influences are often regarded, understandably, as another matter. Nellie Barnes, for example, in an early stylistic study of Native American oral literature, considered only forms preceding the influence of Europeans. **Yet** the example of the Zuni version of the Italian folk tale "The Cock and the Mouse" suggests that, notwithstanding the opinions of scholars of Native American oral literature, **European influence is not always synonymous with the waning of Native American traditions.** The Zuni narrator utilized the European story as an opportunity to exercise his narrative genius, thus leaving his tradition enhanced rather than diminished by the European influence. Such examples should cause scholars researching influences on Native American oral narratives to **reassess their notions of the proper domain of such studies.**

8. The passage is primarily concerned with
	1. assessing the extent of a particular influence on a narrative tradition
	1. pointing out the prevalence of a type of narrative once thought to be rare
	1. reporting results of recent research on a particular narrative tradition
	1. proposing an expansion of the focus of a particular area of research
	1. illustrating the use of an unconventional new research methodology

9. According to the passage, an important focus of research for scholars of Native American oral literature has been
	1. tracing the influence of European tales on Native American narrative traditions
	1. reconstructing the form in which Native American tales existed prior to being influenced by European narrative elements
	1. [O] documenting how Native American oral traditions have influenced one another
	1. identifying features of Native American narratives that betray European influences
	1. analyzing the significance of differences that appear in particular Native American narratives after exposure to European influence

10. The author of the passage refers to Nellie Barnes' study most probably in order to do which of the following?
	1. Point out a weakness common to early stylistic studies of most oral literature
	1. [O] Illustrate a research approach commonly taken by scholars of Native American oral literature
	1. Provide an example of an anomalous approach to the study of Native American oral traditions
	1. Contrast the assumptions guiding early research with those guiding study of Native American oral literature today
	1. Draw attention to an area of research that has been increasingly neglected by scholars in recent years

## Review
1. 推理题，题目问姐妹文化理论支持者和母文化理论支持者最大的分歧点
3. 主旨题
	3. account for a particular behavior不准确，文章重点不是描述动物行为，而是介绍对动物行为的研究。
5. 功能题，根据文章结构及高亮句位置，可知该句是依据existing research观点对B和S实验结果所做的预测，他们的实验就过应该和之前研究结果一样。C选项准确概括该句功能。
