## Questions

**Music critics have consistently defined James P. Johnson as a great early jazz pianist**, originator of the 1920's Harlem " stride " style, and an important **blues and jazz composer**. In addition, however, Johnson was an innovator in classical music, **composing symphonic music** that incorporated American, and especially African-American, traditions.

**Such a blend of musical elements was not entirely new:** by 1924 both Milhaud and Gershwin had composed classical works that incorporated elements of jazz. Johnson, a serious musician more experienced than most classical composers with jazz, blues, *spirituals*, and popular music, was particularly suited to expand Milhaud's and Gershwin's experiments. In 1927 he completed his first large-scale work, the blues- and jazz-inspired *Yamekraw*, which included borrowings from spirituals and **Johnson's own popular songs**. Yamekraw, premiered successfully in Carnegie Hall, was a major achievement for Johnson, becoming his most frequently performed extended work. It demonstrated vividly the possibility of *assimilating* contemporary popular music into the *symphonic* tradition.

1. Which if the following best describes the organization of the passage?
	1. a historical overview is presented, and a particular phenomenon is noted and analyzed
	1. a popular belief is challenged, and a rival interpretation is presented and supported
	1. [O] a common viewpoint is presented and modified, and the modification is supported
	1. an observation is made and rejected, and evidence for that rejection is presented
	1. a common claim is investigated, and an alternative *outlook* is analyzed and criticized

2. The author suggests which of the following about most classical composers of the early 1920s?
	1. they were strongly influenced by the musical experiments of Milhaud and Gershwin
	1. [O] they had little working familiarity with such forms of American music as jazz, blues, and popular songs.
	1. [O] they made few attempts to introduce innovations into the classical symphonic tradition.

3. The passage states that Johnson composed all of the following EXCEPT :
	1. jazz works
	1. popular songs
	1. symphonic music
	1. [O] spirituals
	1. blues pieces

The nearly circular orbits of planets in our solar system led scientists to expect that planets around other stars would also reside in circular orbits. However, most known extrasolar planets reside in highly elongated, not circular, orbits. Why? The best clue comes from *comets* in our solar system. Comets formed in circular orbits but were gravitationally *flung* into their present-day elliptical orbits when they ventured too close to planets. Astronomers suspect that pairs of planets also engage in this __slingshot activity__, leaving them in *disturbed*, elliptical orbits. If two planets form in close orbits, one will be scattered inward(toward its star), the other outward. They will likely then travel close enough to neighboring planets to disturb their orbits also.

4. According to the passage, which of the following factors help account for the elliptical shape of the orbits of extrasolar planet?
	1. [O] the planet's formation in close proximity to other planets
	1. [O] the gravitational influence of planets whose original orbits have been disturbed
	1. the gravitational influence of comets

5. The passage suggests that two planets formed in close orbits that engaged in __slingshot activity__ would be likely to
	1. [O] deflect away from each other
	1. [O] change the shape of each other's orbit
	1. [O] affect the orbits of any neighboring planets

According to the conventional view, *serfdom* in nineteenth-century Russia inhibited economic growth. In this view Russian *peasants*' status as *serfs* kept them poor through burdensome taxes in cash, in labor, and *in kind*; through **restrictions on mobility**, and through various forms of coercion. Melton, however, argues that serfdom was perfectly compatible with economic growth, because many Russian serfs were able to get around landlord's __rules and regulations__. __If serfs could pay for passports, they were usually granted permission to leave the estate.__ If they could pay the fine, they **could establish a separate household**; and if they had the resources, they could **hire laborers to cultivate the communal lands**, while they themselves engaged in trade or worked as migrant laborers in cities.

6. It can be inferred from the passage that the __"rules and regulations"__ affecting serfdom in Russia involved
	1. [O] responsibility for the work needed to accomplish certain defined tasks
	1. [O] restrictions on freedom of movement
	1. [O] limitations on the ability to set up an independent household.

7. The __highlighted sentence__ has which of the following functions in the passage?
	1. [O] it provides support for an argument presented in the preceding sentence
	1. [O] it provides evidence that helps undermine a view introduced in the first sentence
	1. it raises a question that the succeeding sentence will resolve.

The *dusky* salamander lives only in slow-moving streams where organic debris settles and accumulates. In almost all places in New York State where dusky salamanders used to live, suburban development has cleared uplands and put down asphalt. As a result, rainwater now runs directly into streams, causing increased flow that slows the accumulation of organic sediments. Therefore, it is probably the increased flow caused by suburban development that is responsible for the dusky salamander's virtual disappearance from New York State.

8. Which if the following, if true, most strongly supports the argument?
	1. Since 1980 the suburban population of New York State has grown ten times faster than urban population.
	1. Dusky salamanders have disappeared in the past ten years from some suburban areas of New York State that were originally developed more than a century ago and that have not experienced significant development for decades.
	1. [O] The two-line salamander, a species that lives in both slow and swift moving waters, continues to thrive in streams in New York State from which dusky salamanders have disappeared.
	1. Suburban development in New York State contributes significantly to pollution of local streams with lawn fertilizers that are poisonous to most small aquatic animals.
	1. Much of the suburban development in New York State has been occurring in areas that never provided prime habitat for dusky salamanders.

While the influence of British magazines in shaping public opinion predates the nineteenth century, it was during the 1800s that mass distribution became possible and an explosion in periodical *readership* occurred, vastly increasing magazine's opinion-shaping powers. The role of magazines as arbiters of nineteenth-century taste is seen in their depictions of the London theater. The magazines accorded some *legitimacy* to **East End working-class theaters** that mirrored the format of the *fashionable* West End theaters serving middle-and upper-class audiences. However, the magazines also depicted music halls-which competed for patronage with all theaters-as places where crass entertainment corrupted spectators's taste and morals. Finally, they suggested that popular demand for *substandard* *fare* created a market unfriendly to higher expressions of dramatic art.

9. the author of the passage **attributes** the influence of British periodicals in shaping public opinion in the nineteenth century in part **to**
	1. a growing public interest in reading opinion pieces
	1. an increase in the relative number of readers from the middle and upper classes
	1. changes in the way in which magazines were distributed
	1. magazines's increased coverage of theater and popular entertainment
	1. changes in magazine format that attracted a wider readership

10. the author of the passage mentions **"East End working-class theaters"** primarily in order to
	1. illustrate a point about the ability of magazines to sway public opinion
	1. contrast the kinds of entertainment presented in East End and West End theaters
	1. make a point about how spectators' tastes influenced the offerings at different kind of theaters
	1. explain how magazine chose which kinds of entertainment to cover.
	1. identify factors that helped make certain theaters fashionable
