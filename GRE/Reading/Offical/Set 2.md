## Questions

In the 1970s, *Danish* researchers observed surprisingly low frequencies of heart diseases among Greenland's indigenous populations that typically ate *fatty* fish, *seals*, and whales. The researchers attributed the protective effect to the foods' content of *omega-3 fatty acids*. Many studies of omega-3s have been conducted since, but **their findings can be interpreted differently.**

In 2006 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a review of studies on seafood consumption, concluding that eating seafood reduces the risk of heart disease but *judging the studies too inconsistent to decide* if omega-3 fats were responsible. In contrast, __investigators from Harvard__ published a very positive report, stating that even modest consumption of fish omega-3s would substantially reduce coronary deaths and total mortality. 

**Differences in interpretation** explain how scientists examining the same studies **could arrive at such different conclusions.** The two groups, for example, had conflicting views of a study published in the British Medical Journal that found no overall effect of omega-3s on heart disease risk or mortality, although a subset of the data displayed a 14 percent reduction in total mortality that did not reach statistical significance. The IOM team interpreted the "nonsignificant" result as evidence of the need for caution, whereas the Harvard group saw the data as consistent with studies reporting the benefit of omega-3s.

1. It can be inferred that the author mentions a **study published in the British Medical Journal** primarily in order to
	1. show how ambiguity in research reports may lead to unfounded recommendations
	1. suggest that certain data dismissed as "nonsignificant" were in fact quite important
	1. identify an error that led to discrepancies in researchers' conclusions
	1. illustrate a difference in matters of interpretation
	1. call into question the conclusions of two groups of researchers

2. According to the passage, **the report issued by the IOM** and the **explanation offered by the Danish researchers** differed on the issue of whether
	1. [O] the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids was responsible for observed reductions in the risk of heart disease
	1. the consumption of seafood has an effect on a person's likelihood of developing heart disease
	1. seafood is a significant enough source of omega-3 fatty acids for its consumption to affect human health
	1. factors other than diet are primarily responsible for determining a person's likelihood of developing heart disease
	1. the frequency of heart disease among Greenland's indigenous populations could be related to diet.

3. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about the __"investigators from Harvard"__?
	1. Their conclusions were based on data that differed significantly from the data reviewed by the IOM.
	1. Their conclusions about omega-3 fats were more tentative than those reached by the authors of the study published in the British Medical Journal.
	1. They would likely agree with the explanation offered by the Danish researchers for why Greenland's indigenous populations displayed low frequencies of heart disease
	1. They would likely consider the report issued by the IOM to be incorrect about the value of seafood consumption but correct about the value of omega-3 fats.
	1. They would likely argue that more research is needed before researchers can determine whether the consumption of omega-3 fats has a beneficial effect on human health.

The disappearance of *Steller's* *sea cow* from the Bering and *Copper islands* by 1768 has long been blamed on intensive hunting. But its disappearance took only 28 years from the time Steller first described the species, a remarkably short time for hunting alone to *depopulate* the islands, especially given the large populations initially reported. However, by 1750, hunters had also targeted nearby sea otter populations. **Fewer otters would have allowed *sea urchins'* grazing pressure on *kelp* forests to increase.** **Sea cows were totally dependent on kelp** for food, and within a decade of the onset of otter hunting, Steller noted that the islands' **sea cows appeared *malnourished*.**

4. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about **kelp forests** in the Bering and Copper islands between 1750 and 1768?
	1. They were reduced significantly.
	1. They disappeared entirely from the region.
	1. They were the primary food source for sea otters.
	1. They were harvested in record numbers by humans.
	1. They increased pressure on sea urchin populations.

5. According to the passage, it is likely that during the mid-1700s, **sea urchin populations** near the Bering and Copper islands
	1. were diminished by sea cow predation
	1. experienced substantial increases
	1. migrated to waters with more plentiful food supplies
	1. were reduced by the pressures of hunting
	1. appeared to be malnourished

Romley: The Laurence Papyrus, a manuscript on the circulation of blood, was made about 1700BC. However, the text is in a language that had not been in common use since 2700BC. So the Laurence Papyrus must be a copy of an older manuscript, and the understanding of circulation must date to at least 2700BC. 

Vargas: Not necessarily. In 1628 William Harvey published his investigations of the circulation of blood in a by-then-dead language, Latin.

6. Vargas responds to Romley's argument by doing which of the following?
	1. Arguing that Romley's argument applies only to a special case
	1. Contending that one of the dates introduced as evidence to support Romley's conclusion is wrong
	1. Contending that Romley's conclusion is inconsistent with generally accepted views of the history of medicine
	1. Proposing a counterexample to a generalization implicit in the formulation of Romley's argument
	1. Proposing a minor *qualification* of Romley's conclusion that would serve to *shield it from* a potential objection

In the late nineteenth century, numerous African American women's literary clubs met regularly to discuss literary works. Although clubwomen often called their literary meetings "classes", their __practices__ were radically different from those found in *turn-of-the-century* academic settings. For example, the culture of reading cultivated by these clubs *de-emphasized* one authoritative perspective on literary texts; instead, it encouraged women to determine for themselves the importance of the texts they read. For instance, a set of questions discussed by members reading Scott's Ivanhoe was sufficiently *open-ended* to suggest that there were no "right" answers. Rather, the questions were designed to emphasize the importance of careful reading, of individual interpretation, and of "being able to form and hold one's own opinion."

7. The passage suggests that members of the women's reading clubs would agree with which of the following about the reading of literary texts?
	1. The clubs should be reading different literary texts from those being read in academic settings.
	1. While the clubs should focus primarily on the reading of literary texts, they should consider nonliterary texts as well.
	1. The reading practices that prevailed at the clubs are more suitable for some literary text than for others.
	1. Equally careful readings of a literary text can result in divergent interpretations of that text.
	1. The lack of any authoritative perspective on a given literary text makes the reading of that text more difficult.

8. In the context in which it appears, "__practices__" most nearly means
	1. rehearsals
	1. regulations
	1. attempts
	1. [O] procedures
	1. preparations

Recent appraisals of developing media technologies, such as the Internet, have emphasized their potential to fragment audiences. This fragmentation is *presumed* to result because the technologies allow and even encourage people to narrow the focus of their *media consumption* to pursue their individualized news interests and needs. As Katz has argued, such a narrowed focus is problematic for the functioning of modern democracies. Fragmented audiences are unlikely to consume a common diet of news, potentially leaving them under informed about central issues facing a nation. Individually tailored media use, Katz writes, "seems to be fast *displacing* national *comings-together*, and pleasure seems to be pushing public affairs ever more out of sight." Such an environment threatens the very foundation of political systems based on assumptions of citizen awareness and involvement.

9. It can be inferred from the passage that Katz would be **LEAST likely to agree** with which of the following statements?
	1. When audience fragmentation occurs, individuals' news interests will still tend to include the most important issues facing the nation.
	1. The process leading to media audience fragmentation has unhealthy implications for the functioning of a democracy.
	1. The ability of people to select sources of news that more closely suit their own interests is facilitating audience fragmentation.
	1. There are features of new and emerging media technologies that encourage audience fragmentation.
	1. There will probably be news of major importance about which some media users will remain inadequately informed under conditions of audience fragmentation.

10. Which of the following most accurately presents the passage's treatment of Katz's position?
	1. The position is rejected as relying too heavily on unsubstantiated assumptions.
	1. The position is considered sympathetically but ultimately rejected as too *sweeping*.
	1. The position is put forward as a compelling hypothesis that stands in need of testing.
	1. The position is adopted in modified form after being adjusted to meet objections.
	1. The position is accepted without reservation and cited as authoritative support.
