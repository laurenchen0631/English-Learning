In A *Raisin* in the Sun, Lorraine Hansberry does not reject integration or the economic and moral promise of the American dream; rather, she remains loyal to this dream while looking, realistically, at its incomplete __realization__. Once we recognize this dual vision, we can accept the play's ironic *nuances* as deliberate social *commentaries* by Hansberry rather than as the "unintentional" irony that *Bigsby* attributes to the work. Indeed, a curiously persistent refusal to credit Hansberry with a capacity for intentional irony has led __some critics__ to interpret the play's thematic conflicts as mere confusion, contradiction, or eclecticism. *Isaacs*, for example, cannot easily reconcile Hansberry's intense concern for her race with her ideal of human *reconciliation*. But the play's complex view of Black self-esteem and human solidarity as compatible is no more "contradictory" than *Du Bois'* famous, well-considered ideal of ethnic self-awareness coexisting with human unity, or *Fanon's* emphasis on an ideal internationalism that also accommodates national identities and roles.

1. The author of the passage would probably consider which of the following judgments to be most similar to the reasoning of the __highlighted critics__?
    1. The world is certainly flat, therefore, the person proposing to sail around it is unquestionably foolhardy.
    1. Radioactivity cannot be directly perceived; therefore, a scientist could not possibly control it in a laboratory.
    1. [O] The painter of this picture could not intend it to be funny, therefore, its humor must result from a lack of skill.
    1. Traditional social mores are beneficial to culture, therefore, anyone who deviates from them acts destructively.
    1. Filmmakers who produce documentaries deal exclusively with facts; therefore, a filmmaker who reinterprets particular events is misleading us

2. Select the sentence in the passage in which the author provides **examples that reinforce an argument against a critical response** cited earlier in the passage.
    1. In A Raisin in the Sun, Lorraine Hansberry does not ... at its incomplete realization. 
    1. Once we recognize ... the work.
    1. Indeed, a curiously persistent refusal ... eclecticism.
    1. Isaacs, for example, cannot easily ... reconciliation.
    1. But the play's complex ... identities and roles.

3. In the context in which it appears, "__realization__" most nearly means
    1. understanding
    1. accomplishment
    1. depiction
    1. recognition
    1. discovery

*Objectively*, of course, the various ecosystems that sustain life on the planet proceed independently of human agency, just as they operated before the *hectic* ascendancy of Homo sapiens. But it is also true that it is better or worse, been substantially modified by human culture. Nor is this simply the work of the industrial centuries. It has been happening since the days of ancient Mesopotamia. It is *coeval* with the origin of writing and has occurred throughout our social existence. And it is this irreversibly modified world, from the polar caps to the equatorial forests, that is all the nature we have.

4. It can be inferred from the passage that the author would agree with which of the following statement?
    1. Overtime the impact of human culture on the natural world has been largely benign.
    1. [O] It is a mistake to think that the natural world contains many areas of pristine wilderness.
    1. The only substantial effects that human agency has had on ecosystems have been *inadvertent*

5. The author mentions "ancient Mesopotamia" primarily in order to
    1. provide some geographical and historical contend for an earlier claim about the ascendancy of Homo sapiens
    1. support the idea that the impact of human culture on nature was roughly the same in the ancient world as in later times
    1. identify a place where the relationship between culture and nature, was largely positive
    1. emphasize, the extent to which the modification of nature by human culture preceded the industrial period
    1. make a connection between the origins of writing and other aspects of human cultural development

As an example of the devastation *wrought* on music publishers by the *photocopier*, one executive noted that for a recent *choral* festival with 1,200 singers, the festival's organizing committee purchased only 12 copies of the music published by her company that was performed as part of the festival.

6. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the support the example lends to the executive's *contention* that music publishers have been devastated by the photocopier?
    1. Only a third of the 1,200 singers were involved in performing the music published by the executive's company.
    1. Half of the singers at the festival had already heard the music they were to perform before they began to practice for the festival.
    1. Because of shortages in funding, the organizing committee of the choral festival required singers to purchase their own copies of the music performed at the festival.
    1. Each copy of music that was performed at the festival was shared by two singers.
    1. As a result of publicity generated by its performance at the festival, the type of music performed at the festival became more widely known.

A tall tree can transport a hundred gallons of water a day from its roots deep underground to the treetop. Is this movement propelled by pulling the water from above or pushing it from below? The pull mechanism has long been favored by most scientists. First proposed in the late 1800's, the theory relies on a property of water not commonly associated with fluids: its tensile strength. *Instead of making a clean break, water evaporating from treetops tugs on the remaining water molecules, with that tug extending from molecule to molecule all the way down to the roots.* The tree itself does not actually push or pull; all the energy for lifting water comes from the sun's evaporative power.

7. Which of the following statements is supported by the passage?
    1. [O] The pull theory is not *universally* accepted by scientists.
    1. [O] The pull theory depends on one of water's physical properties.
    1. The pull theory originated earlier than did the push theory.

8. The passage provides information on each of the following EXCEPT
    1. when the pull theory originated
    1. the amount of water a tall tree can transport
    1. the significance of water's tensile strength in the pull theory
    1. the role of the sun in the pull theory
    1. the mechanism underlying water's tensile strength

The most plausible justification for higher taxes on automobile fuel is that fuel consumption harms the environment and thus adds to the costs of the traffic *congestion*. But the fact that burning fuel creates these "negative externalities" does not imply that *no tax on fuel could ever be too high.* Economics is precise about the tax that should, in principle, be *levied* to deal with negative externalities: __the tax on a liter of the fuel should be equal to the harm caused by using a liter of fuel.__ If the tax is more than that, its costs (including the inconvenience to those who would rather have used their cars) will __exceed__ its benefits(including any reduction in congestion and pollution).

9. Im the context in which it appears,"__exceed__" most nearly means
    1. outstrip
    1. magnify
    1. *delimit*
    1. offset
    1. supplant

10. Which of the following best characterizes the function of the __highlighted portion__ of the passage?
    1. It restates a point made earlier in the passage.
    1. It provides the evidence on which a theory is based.
    1. [O] It presents a specific application of a general principle.
    1. It summarizes a justification with which the author disagrees.
    1. It suggests that the benefits of a particular strategy have been overestimated.

## Review
1. 在《太阳下的葡萄干》一书中，洛兰·汉斯贝里并不排斥美国梦中的种族平等以及经济和道德上的许诺，相反她仍然忠于这个理想，同时也现实地看到没有完全实现这个理想的一面。一旦我们认识到这种双重的观点，我们就能够领会这个剧本所包含的汉斯贝里对社会所作的深思熟虑的评论的讽刺寓意，而不是比格斯比归之于作品的那种“不自觉”的讽刺含义。实际上，一种坚持不承认汉斯贝里具有自觉讽刺能力的怪现象，致使某些评论家把剧本主题冲突解释成只是一片混乱、矛盾百出、或折中调和。例如艾萨克斯不能够顺利地把汉斯贝里对她种族的强烈关怀同她的人类和解的理想统一起来。但是，这部剧本所体现的认为黑人自尊和人类团结可以和谐共存的复杂观点同杜波依斯著名的考虑周到的少数民族自我意识和人类团结共存的理想，或者同范农所强调的包容民族特色和民族角色的理想的国际主义一样.都是统一的、并不“矛盾”的。
    1. 世界平，所以航行的人都很荒谬。逻辑：前提之下，凡是不遵守的全是错的，否命题；排除异己
    2. 辐射不能感知，所以科学家不能在实验室里控制。逻辑：因素消极，类似推论消极；否定类推
    3. 画家无意搞笑，所以幽默源于缺乏技巧。逻辑：本意并非为之，特征源于缺陷；过犹不及，critics不认为作者有intentional irony的能力，因此C项painter不具有intentional funny的能力与题意相符
    4. 传统社会道德观念有利，违反者自崩塌。逻辑：前提之下，凡是不遵守的全是错的，否命题；排除异己
    5. 纪录片谨遵事实，重述者偏离事实。逻辑：前提之下，不遵守者取反，否命题；排除异己

6. 逻辑单题, 以下事件可以作为复印机对音乐出版公司造成破坏的例子：一位主管发现，为了最近的一个有一千两百名歌手参加的合唱音乐节，该音乐节的组织委员会购买了12份谱作为音乐节的演出作品，12份乐谱的复制品是由她的公司发行的。
    1. 1200位歌手中只有三分之一（就是400人）需要这个内容。对结论有所削弱，但是400人买12分copy仍然很少。所以原结论基本不受影响。
    3. 组织者要求歌手买自己的copy。论据中增加这个事实之后，组织者只买12copy就不一定是买完之后photocopy了，可能需要的歌手都会自己买。所以原文结论明显被削弱。因此这个选项削弱程度很强。

8. 细节题
    5. 文章没有解释water’s tensile strength背后的原理，只是描述了tensile strength表面上是如何运作的

10. 词句作用题
    1. 不是restate，而是进一步更准确度的描述
