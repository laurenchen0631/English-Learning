## Questions

Although some __skeptics__ points to Arctic places such as the **high latitudes of Greenland, where temperatures seem to have fallen**, a recent scientific report concludes that in **recent decades average temperatures have increased** faster in the Arctic than elsewhere. Scientists have long suspected that several factors lead to greater temperature swings at Earths polar regions than elsewhere. First, most of the Arctic is covered in snow and ice, which are highly reflective; if snow and ice melt, the exposed soil, which absorbs heat, serves to accelerate warming. Second, the polar atmosphere is thin, so little energy is required to warm it. Third, less solar energy is lost in evaporation at the frigid poles than in the tropics.

1. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The passage mentions which of the following as **factors that might lead to large temperature swings** in Earths polar regions?
	1. [O] the amount of energy lost due to evaporation at the poles
	1. [O] soil exposure due to melting snow
	1. [O] the relatively thin atmosphere at the poles

2. In pointing to the apparent temperature change in the high latitudes of Greenland, the skeptics mentioned in the passage intend to raise as a question whether
	1. Greenland is less likely to experience extreme temperature changes than are other areas of the Arctic.
	1. [O] Those more localized temperature drops might indicate an important trend not captured by the upward trend of average Arctic temperatures.
	1. There **might be** a reversal of the temperature trend **in the high latitudes of Greenland.**
	1. The factors that cause temperature change in the high latitudes of Greenland are different from those that affect the rest of the Arctic.
	1. Greenland has more ice and snow on the ground than do other areas of the Arctic.

**Although** **social learning** [the acquisition of specific behaviors by observing other individuals exhibiting those behaviors] **is well documented among** fish, few studies have investigated social learning within a developmental context in these taxa. **Rather than investigating the development of a particular skill,** Chapman, Ward, and Krause **investigated the role of group density** during development in later foraging success in laboratory-housed *guppies*. When raised with **a small number of conspecifics** [members of the same species], **guppies were quicker** to locate food by following a trained adult guppy **than were guppies raised in large groups.** This __counterintuitive__ finding is explained by the fact that guppies *reared* in the high-density condition were less likely to *shoal* [swim in a group] with others and, therefore, were less likely to learn the benefits of social learning. __Instead, fish reared in high-density situations may learn that conspecifics are to be viewed as competitors, rather than as potential sources of adaptive information.__ This finding **suggests that at least for guppies, the early social environment may have an effect on the capacity for social learning**, if not on the socially learned behaviors themselves.

3. Which of the following statements best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?
	1. It casts doubt on an interpretation cited earlier in the passage.
	1. It proposes an alternative to a hypothesis mentioned earlier in the passage.
	1. [O] It suggests an explanation for a particular finding.
	1. It notes an apparent discrepancy between two research findings.
	1. It identifies a flaw in a particular line of reasoning.

4. Which of the following hypothetical expectations would **make the finding mentioned in the passage** __"counterintuitive"__?
	1. That higher population density would have a negative impact on guppies' ability to learn from observing other guppies
	1. That guppies would experience the highest rate of social learning during the earliest stages of their development
	1. That guppies would be more likely to shoal in conditions of low population density than they would be in conditions of high population density
	1. That social learning among guppies would increase in conditions where guppies are exposed to a greater number of conspecifics
	1. That the benefits of social learning would differ depending on whether guppies are reared in high- or low-density populations

5. Which of the following can be inferred **about the study** by Chapman, Ward, and Krause?
	1. It was initially designed to investigate something other than social learning.
	1. [?O] It required researchers to observe individual guppies at multiple points in their life spans.
	1. It pointed to the possibility that population density may have little to do with guppies' social learning.
	1. [?O] It required the observation of guppies under conditions that closely mimicked the conditions of guppies in the wild.
	1. It indicated that guppies gain adaptive information from being reared with a relatively large number of conspecifics.

__Barley was the first grain to be cultivated by the ancient Egyptians.__ **There is ample evidence that barley was baked into loaves that were fermented to make beer.** There is, **however, no indication that Egyptians of that period ever ate loaves of barley** or that they cooked barley to make any other food. Since the possibility that __they consumed barley raw__ can be safely dismissed, it seems probable that at one period the ancient Egyptians consumed cultivated grain in the form of beer only.

6. In the argument given, the two highlighted portions play which of the following roles?
	1. The first introduces the circumstance, the explanation of which is at issue in the argument; the second is an assumption that is explicitly made in drawing the conclusion of the argument.
	1. The first introduces the circumstance, the explanation of which is at issue in the argument; the second is evidence that was used to support a position to which the argument is opposed.
	1. The first provides evidence to support the main conclusion; the second introduces a phenomenon that the argument seeks to explain.
	1. The first provides evidence to support the main conclusion; the second states a hypothesis that the argument as a whole seeks to refute.
	1. [O] The first provides evidence to support the main conclusion; the second is a **statement that is explicitly rejected in drawing that conclusion.**

**Postmodern music** often explores the *confluence* of genres previously thought incompatible. The boundaries between **"popular music"** (which often draws from a variety of cultures) and what is commonly considered "art music" (which often draws from a narrower cultural spectrum) are frequently blurred or obliterated. Although __art music__ has reflected some mixing of cultures for centuries, and some art music composers in the first half of the twentieth century made use of genre mixing, **postmodern music is distinct from pre-1960s art music compositions.** Technology has facilitated access to a multitude of international musical styles. While baroque, classical, romantic, and modern composers may have had access to some music from outside their own cultures, such access cannot compare to that presently available through **recordings, radio, and the Internet, nurturing a postmodern sensibility in contemporary composers' works.**

7. It can be inferred that the author of the passage would be likely to agree with which of the following assertions about postmodern music?
	1. It has been influenced by technological developments that occurred in the twentieth century.
	1. It remains largely **uninfluenced by the narrower cultural** spectrum of traditional art music.
	1. It has been shaped by the diversity of musical influences to which postmodern composers have been exposed.

8. The highlighted reference to __"art music"__ serves primarily to
	1. illustrate a point about why postmodern composers frequently mix different musical genres
	1. show how a culture`s artistic products can be enriched through the inclusion of outside influences
	1. challenge a tendency to identify some music as art music to distinguish it from popular music
	1. [O] address a possible objection to the author`s central point about postmodern music
	1. question a particular assumption about the distinguishing features of postmodern music

A recent exhibition of works by late-nineteenth-century painters Mary Cassatt, Berthe Morisot, and Eva Gonzales offered a rich visual __counterpart__ to **studies focusing new attention on the social and ideological forces** that influenced their work. **The paintings by Gonzales were particularly illuminating.** Long marginalized by scholars as little more than an apprentice of Edouard Manet, Gonzales is revealed by the exhibition as possessing remarkable, if uneven, talents. Given the exhibition`s focus, and especially the provocative new emphasis on Gonzales, the accompanying catalog proved disappointing. Three often-quoted essays by critics contemporary to the artists-essays in themselves noteworthy but historical artifacts nonetheless-provided the exhibition with its only critical readings. Thus, a significant opportunity for scholarly debate was not only lost but even seemed pointedly avoided.

9. Select the sentence in which the author **describes and counters an assessment** of a particular artist.
	1. A recent exhibition...
	2. The paintings by Gonzales...
	3. Long marginalized by scholars as ...
	4. Given the exhibition`s focus, ....
	5. Three often-quoted essays ...
	6. Thus, a significant opportunity ...

10. In the context in which it appears, "counterpart to" most nearly means
	1. duplicate of
	1. alternate to
	1. complement to
	1. opposite of
	1. emblem of
