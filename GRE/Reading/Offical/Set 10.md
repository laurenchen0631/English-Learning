Certain practices common in the early United States **make it easy for historians to underestimate** the extent of American women's paid labor. Under the legal principle called coverture, married women had no legally recognized economic existence apart from their husbands and could not receive wages for their work. Records of payments for *outwork* (work performed in the home on a piece-rate basis) show male names as wage recipients. One has to look in the columns recording the amount of work completed to see that female names are listed as producers. Furthermore, most wage laborers were paid partly in goods and received cash wages only quarterly or once or twice a year. The infrequency of such payments has sometimes made it difficult for historians to recognize them as wages.

1. According to the passage, payments to wage laborers in the early United States were
	1. usually lower for outwork than for other kinds of wage labor
	1. consistently higher for male workers than for female workers
	1. paid to male workers at more frequent intervals than to female workers
	1. often paid partly in forms other than cash
	1. often not recorded by employers

2. The passage suggests which of the following about records of payments for outwork?
	1. They have only recently received attention from historians.
	1. [O] They could easily be misinterpreted by historians.
	1. They have frequently been overlooked by historians.
	1. They show a discrepancy between the amount of men's and women's wages.
	1. They fail to reflect the infrequency of payments for completed work.

The occurrence of dense aggregations of the fruit-bearing tree *Brosimum alicastrum* on or near Maya ruin complexes in Central America was initially interpreted as evidence of ancient Maya *silviculture*, i.e., the *stands* were *relicts* of *orchards* planted by the Maya. Later work, however, suggested that the stands resulted from the Artibeus bats that *roost* among the ruins. The bats fly to the forest, collect the fruit, bring it back to their roost, eat the fruit, and then discard the undamaged seed. __The continual input of bat-dispersed seed__ has maintained the *clumps* of B. alicastrum around ruins for many hundreds of years.

This observation, however, does not negate the possibility that B. alicastrum was used and managed by the Maya. In fact, if we examine the behavior, rather than the density or location, of these tree populations, we are presented with strong evidence of deliberate genetic improvement. This is especially notable in the B. alicastrum trees that cluster around the Maya ruins at Tikal in Guatemala: these trees' productivity is almost twice that of trees in Veracruz, Mexico, under almost identical environmental conditions.

3. __"The continual input of bat-dispersed seed"__ is mentioned in the passage as part of an explanation for
	1. the productivity of certain stands of B. alicastrum
	1. the presence of stands of B. alicastrum in certain locations
	1. the displacement of fruit trees from Maya orchards
	1. changes in the appearance of Maya ruins
	1. changes in the forest around Maya ruins

4. The passage implies which of the following about the B. alicastrum trees observed at Tikal?
	1. They represent a strain that may have been brought to Tikal from Mexico.
	1. They represent a strain that may have been bred by the Maya to increase its yield.
	1. Their fruit is preferred by Artibeus bats to the fruit of other tree species.
	1. They are more numerous around the ruins at Tikal than B. alicastrum trees are at other Maya sites.
	1. Their seed is able to withstand damage that might otherwise prevent germination.

5. The passage implies which of the following about the B. alicastrum trees observed in Veracruz?
	1. They are a product of selective breeding.
	1. Their development has been influenced by bat behavior.
	1. They bear an inferior quality of fruit.
	1. They are poorly suited to the growing conditions at Veracruz.
	1. They differ significantly from the trees at Tikal in their genetic makeup.

Homeowners often *weatherize* their homes, that is, they add *insulation* and seal up gaps to avoid *drafts*. In the past, many homeowners used insulation that releases *formaldehyde*, a gas that at high concentrations causes health problems. Such insulation is now banned. It is still possible, however, to create dangerous levels of formaldehyde by weatherizing a house, since reducing airflow increases the concentrations of any gas being released into the air of the house, and __________.

6. Which of the following most logically completes the argument?
	1. any formaldehyde-releasing insulation installed before the ban has long since stopped releasing formaldehyde
	1. many items in a typical home release measurable quantities of formaldehyde
	1. the insulation that releases formaldehyde was easy to install in an existing house
	1. almost all of the fresh air that enters a weatherized house enters through heating and cooling vents
	1. certain other kinds of insulation present other health risks if not used properly

One might assume the most admired architecture would be the best built. This was generally true in the past, but in the twentieth century, when new materials and new aesthetic theories often drove architects to *cavalier* experimentation, even celebrated architects *fell short*. __When designing the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers turned the building literally inside out.__ Previously hidden elements such as pipes, ducts, and elevators were exposed to view-and exposed to the elements. The result might have been *foreseen*: after only twenty years, the **building was closed for a two-year renovation**. Although the authorities maintained that the unexpectedly large numbers of visitors necessitated the renovation, much of the budget was spent on refurbishing the façade.

7. Which of the following best describes the function of the __highlighted sentence__?
	1. It helps substantiate the author's claims about pre–twentieth-century architecture.
	1. It provides a specific example of the trend cited in the previous sentence.
	1. It bolsters the claim that modern architecture abhors aesthetic experimentation.
	1. It restates the assumption mentioned in the passage's opening sentence.
	1. It marks a transition to a discussion of French architectural trends.

8. Which of the following qualities of the Centre Pompidou forms the basis for the author's critique of Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers' work?
	1. Its popularity
	1. Its initial construction cost
	1. Its size
	1. Its durability
	1. Its location

Despite the __extravagant colors__ of the flowers bees visit, until the early 1900s it was commonly thought that bees were entirely color-blind. To test this, zoologist Karl von Frisch set out an array of dishes on cards. The dish on one card, the only blue card among varying grays, contained sugar water. Once bees learned to visit this card and dish combination, he varied its position in the matrix. Next, he **replaced all the cards and dishes** with a new set of identical materials, only now leaving the blue card's dish empty. The bees nonetheless returned to the blue card. If their vision were monochromatic, they would likely have found at least some of the gray cards indistinguishable from the blue.

9. The author of the passage refers to "extravagant colors" primarily to
	1. validate a view about bees' color vision that was once commonly accepted
	1. suggest why it might be surprising that bees were thought to be color-blind
	1. complicate the debate about bees' color vision
	1. point out a reason for bees' visual limitations
	1. anticipate an objection to the methodology of the experiment described in the passage

10. It can be inferred from the passage that by setting out **new cards** when replacing the dish of sugar water with an empty one, Frisch
	1. was able to record accurately any changes in color that resulted from spills or drops
	1. could subtly alter the color of the card on which the sugar water was placed in each iteration of the experiment
	1. introduced new clues relevant to finding the sugar water's location
	1. succeeded in proving that bees see in only a limited spectrum of color
	1. [O] was able to rule out the possibility that the bees had somehow marked the blue card in previous trials
