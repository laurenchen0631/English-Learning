Two dramatic shifts in *upstate* New York's microfossil record may explain the fate of the region's prehistoric megafauna. First, fossil spores of *Sporormiella*, **a fungus** common in most Pleistocene era sediments that **grows only on the *dung* of large herbivores**, **vanish from the sedimentary record** about 14,000 years ago. Soon after, levels of **microscopic charcoal from landscape fires increase** more than tenfold. Paleontologist Guy Robinson sees a connection: he suggests that local populations of *mastodons* and other big herbivores crashed when the first humans arrived and found the animals, previously unexposed to humans, easy prey. **With most of the huge herbivores wiped out, fire-fueling vegetation accumulated on the landscape. So fires lit by the human newcomers burned hotter** and spread farther than ever before.

1. It can be inferred that Robinson would most likely agree with which of the following claims about fossil Sporormiella spores?
	1. They should appear in the microfossil record in inverse proportion to megafauna fossils.
	1. They should be more plentiful in the microfossil record during periods when microscopic charcoal is also plentiful.
	1. They provide evidence about the timing of the first humans' appearance in upstate New York.
	1. They may have been eliminated from the microfossil record at times because they were destroyed by intense fires.
	1. They tend to decline in the microfossil record during periods in which megafauna populations increased.

2. The passage suggests that large prehistoric herbivores in upstate New York may have
	1. had few predators before the appearance of humans
	1. been responsible for sharp reductions in Sporormiella fungus
	1. been driven to seek new habitats by the spread of landscape fires
	1. peaked in population size around the time when humans first appeared
	1. [O] helped maintain ecological conditions that limited the extent of landscape fires

**Witnesses to a meteor in Australia in 1978 claimed to have heard strange noises** as it streaked overhead. Yet, given that the meteor was 30 kilometers up, if these sounds had come directly from the meteor, people on the ground could not have heard them until almost a minute after the meteor had disappeared. **Physicist Colin Keay hypothesized** that the light given off by a meteor's **trail must be accompanied by invisible electromagnetic radiation in the form of very low frequency (VLF)** radio waves. __Such waves, which travel at the speed of light, would reach the observer when the meteor itself came into view.__

Subsequent experiments in a soundproof chamber showed that many things can act as *transducers* to convert VLF waves into audible vibrations. Aluminum foil, thin wires, pine needles, or dry hair all responded to a VLF field. VLF waves induce small charges in such objects, thereby causing them to vibrate in time with the waves' oscillation. This transducer effect would explain why some people heard the noises while others close by heard nothing. **Those who heard sounds were simply nearer to transducers.** It could also explain why attempts to record meteor sounds have failed: scientists carefully place their microphones away from possible sources of interference.

3. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?
	1. It explains why observers who were looking at the meteor would be **the only ones** who could hear the sounds made as it went overhead.
	1. It explains why the witnesses' claims could **not be verified** by scientific experts.
	1. It shows that Keay's hypothesis provides the **correct explanation** of the sounds heard by observers of the meteor.
	1. It suggests that Keay's hypothesis is capable of explaining an important aspect of the witnesses' observations.
	1. It suggests that Keay's hypothesis is able to explain how observers can **see a fast-moving meteor**.

4. It can be inferred from the passage that if Keay's proposed explanation of meteor sounds is correct, it is true that
	1. [?] meteors themselves **produce no audible vibrations**, even though the meteor does cause the sounds that observers hear
	1. when an observer hears the sounds, it is **his or her own hair** that is causing the audible vibrations
	1. [O] if two observers in widely separated locations hear sounds caused by the same meteor, the audible vibrations that reach the observers are produced by different objects
	1. visible light and VLF radio waves are **the only forms of electromagnetic radiation** that are given off by a meteor's trail
	1. **atmospheric conditions**, such as clouds, that made a meteor invisible to observers on the ground would also prevent those observers from hearing any sounds caused by that meteor

5. The passage suggests that Keay formulated his hypothesis **in response to**
	1. scientists' failure to record meteor sounds
	1. [O] an inference based on the speed of sound in the atmosphere
	1. measurements of the strength and wavelength of electromagnetic radiation from a meteor's trail
	1. the fact that observers who heard meteor sounds were close to objects that could act as transducers of VLF waves
	1. experiments in a soundproof chamber to determine what objects would transduce VLF waves into audible vibrations

In *Artemia*, managers of large orchards are planning to import a leaf-eating moth and release it in their orchards to curb the growth of an exceptionally troublesome weed. **Owners of small farms, however, rely on the weed to crowd out other weeds** from temporarily uncultivated fields, since the other weeds are more difficult to eliminate once established. **Therefore, the moth cannot be released in orchards without causing hardships for owners of small farms.**

6. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument given?
	1. No herbicides can curb the weed's growth without also harming orchard trees.
	1. Once introduced in Artemia, the moth will multiply and reach a stable population.
	1. Once the moth has controlled the weed in the orchards, other weeds will invade them.
	1. In exchange for government permission to import the moth, orchard growers must agree to regularly spray farms near their orchards with a long-lasting spray that repels the moth.
	1. None of the other weeds that grow in Artemia cause any damage to orchard trees.

Even after United States women won voting rights in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, their political status was not entirely settled. For example, did suffrage also imply a right to serve on juries? In examining this issue, the courts considered cases involving the Fifteenth Amendment, which had extended suffrage to African American men, and found that that amendment implied other political rights, including the right to jury service. **For some courts, this parallel implied women's right to jury service; others, however, interpreted the Nineteenth Amendment more narrowly**, reasserting the relevance of common-law standards that distinguished women's citizenship from men's. For many, **women's jury service seemed more threatening** to the status quo than voting rights, as jury service would *impinge on* the domestic duties traditionally assigned to women.

7. The passage suggests which of the following about women`s jury service?
	1. It was **not a high priority** to those women who had fought for the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment.
	1. It was less controversial than jury service by African American men had been at the time when the Fifteenth Amendment was passed.
	1. It was a right clearly implied by the citizenship status conferred on women when they won the right to vote.
	1. It was opposed by some who believed that women`s jury service would be socially disruptive.
	1. It was rejected **by most courts** that considered the Nineteenth Amendment **in light of the Fifteenth Amendment.**

8. The author of the passage mentions **common-law standards** primarily in order to
	1. explain how some courts interpreted the Fifteenth Amendment
	1. cite a model used in the crafting of the Nineteenth Amendment
	1. identify an approach taken by some courts in considering women`s right to jury service
	1. show that men and women were treated differently under common law
	1. contrast women`s political status following the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment with their status before

While data collected by the Current Population Survey (CPS) of the United States showed **an increase in the annual average number of hours of paid employment** for the period 1969–1987, **data collected from employers showed a decrease.** A probable, if partial, explanation is that employers report hours for employees at their *establishment* alone. **If people are working longer hours because they work at more than one job, then establishment surveys may not be a good measure of workers` hours.** And multiple jobholding did increase in the 1980s, especially among women. __In addition, multiple jobholders tend to work long hours.__ It is also possible that the **data collected from establishments do not adequately represent hours at all business establishments** because of various data collection and response problems.

9. The highlighted sentence performs which of the following functions in the passage?
	1. It **provides an explanation** for the increase in multiple jobholding in the 1980s.
	1. [O] It **adds to the explanation for the increase** in the annual average number of hours of paid employment indicated by the CPS data.
	1. It provides evidence that the increase indicated by the CPS data is **due more to men`s than women`s work.**
	1. It describes a **negative consequence** of the phenomenon described in the previous sentence.
	1. It suggests **an explanation for the collection and response problems** described in the subsequent sentence.

10. The author would most likely agree with which of the following statements about the annual average number of hours of employment?
	1. [O] The annual average number of hours of paid employment for the 1969–1987 period increased.
	1. The annual average number of hours of **unpaid employment** for the 1969–1987 period probably decreased.
	1. Data collected from **employers for just the 1980s would show an increase** in the annual average number of hours of paid employment.
	1. Since 1987 there has been **little change** in the annual average number of hours of employment.
	1. The CPS data provide a less reliable indication of the hours workers actually worked than do data collected from employers.

## Review
4. 推理题
	1. 作者只否认了地上的人听到的声音并不来自陨石自身的震动（音速太慢了），但是作者并没有说陨石本身不会发出声音，而A错在说陨石本身不发声。

5. 推理题
	2. 题目问CK形成假设回应的是什么。由文章结构，可知CK假设回应的是段首矛盾现象。而该矛盾是基于对声音传播速度的理解。可知B选项正确。

9. 文章首先介绍矛盾的数据：CPS调查显示从1969年到1987年，有偿雇佣工作者的年平均工作时间增加，但雇主的调查数据显示下降。文章后文试图解释矛盾数据。解释1: 同时干多个工作的人口数量增加。解释2（It is also possible）是，雇主调查数据的代表性有问题
