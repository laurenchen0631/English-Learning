## Questions

Even after numerous products made with artificial *sweeteners* became available, **sugar consumption *per capita* continued to rise.** Now manufacturers are introducing fat-free versions of various foods that they claim have the taste and texture of the traditional high-fat versions. Even if the manufacturers' claim is true, **given that the availability of sugar-free foods did not reduce sugar consumption, it is unlikely that the availability of these fat-free foods will reduce fat consumption.**

1. Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
	1. several kinds of fat substitute are available to manufacturers, each of which gives a noticeably different taste and texture to products that contain it.
	1. [O] the products made with artificial sweeteners did not taste like products made with sugar.
	1. the foods brought out in sugar-free versions did not generally have reduced levels of fat, but many of the fat-free versions about to be introduced are low in sugar.
	1. people who regularly consume products containing artificial sweeteners are more likely than others to consume fat-free foods.
	1. not all foods containing fat can be produced in fat-free versions.

Recent studies of sediment in the North Atlantic's deep waters reveal possible cyclical patterns in the history of Earth's climate. The rock fragments in these sediments are too large to have been transported there by ocean currents, they must have reached their present locations by **traveling in large icebergs that floated long distances from their point of origin before melting.** Geologist Gerard Bond noticed that some of the **sediment grains were stained with iron oxide, evidence that they originated in locales where glaciers had overrun outcrops of red sandstone.** Bond's detailed analysis of deep-water sediment cores showed changes in the mix of sediment sources over time: the proportion of these red-stained grains fluctuated back and forth from lows of 5 percent to highs of about 17 percent, and these fluctuations occurred in a nearly regular 1,500-year cycle.

Bond hypothesized that the alternating cycles might be evidence of changes in ocean-water circulation and therefore in Earth's climate. He knew that the sources of the red-stained grains were generally closer to the North Pole than were the places yielding a high proportion of "clean" *grams*. At certain times, apparently, **more icebergs from the Arctic Ocean in the far north were traveling south well into the North Atlantic before melting and shedding their sediment.**

Ocean waters are constantly moving, and water temperature is both a cause and an effect of this movement. As water cools, it becomes denser and sinks to the ocean's bottom. During some periods, the bottom layer of the world's oceans comes from cold, dense water sinking in the far North Atlantic. This causes the warm surface waters of the Gulf Stream to be pulled northward. Bond realized that during such periods, the influx of these warm surface waters into northern regions could cause a large proportion of the icebergs that bear red grains to melt before traveling very far into the North Atlantic. But sometimes the ocean's dynamic changes, and waters from the Gulf Stream do not travel northward in this way. **During these periods, surface waters in the North Atlantic would generally be colder, permitting icebergs bearing red-stained grains to travel farther south in the North Atlantic before melting and depositing their sediment.**

The onset of the so-called Little Ice Age (1300-1860), which followed the Medieval Warm Period of the eighth through tenth centuries, may represent the most recent time that the ocean's dynamic changed in this way. If ongoing climate-history studies support Bond's hypothesis of 1,500-year cycles, scientists may establish a major natural rhythm in Earth's temperatures that could then be extrapolated into the future. Because the midpoint of the Medieval Warm Period was about AD. 850, an extension of Bond's cycles would place the midpoint of the next warm interval in the twenty-fourth century.

2. According to the passage, which of the following is true of the rock fragments contained in the sediments studied by Bond?
	1. the majority of them are composed of red sandstone
	1. they must have reached their present location over 1,500 years ago.
	1. they were carried by icebergs to their present location.
	1. Most of them were carried to their present location during a warm period in Earth's climatic history.
	1. They are unlikely to have been carried to their present location during the Little Ice Age

3. In the final paragraph of the passage, the author is concerned primarily with
	1. answering a question about Earth's climatic history
	1. pointing out a potential flaw in Bond's hypothesis
	1. suggesting a new focus for the study of ocean sediments
	1. tracing the general history of Earth's climate
	1. discussing possible implications of Bond's hypothesis.

4. According to the passage, Bond hypothesized that which of the following circumstances would allow red-stained sediment grains to reach more southerly latitudes?
	1. Warm waters being pulled northward from the Gulf Stream
	1. Climatic conditions causing icebergs to melt relatively quickly
	1. Icebergs containing a higher proportion of iron oxide than usual
	1. The formation of more icebergs than usual in the far north
	1. the presence of cold surface waters in the North Atlantic

5. It can be inferred from the passage that in sediment cores from the North Atlantic's deep waters, the portions that correspond to the Little Ice Age
	1. differ very little in composition from the portions that correspond to the Medieval Warm Period
	1. fluctuate significantly in composition between the portions corresponding to the 1300s and the portions corresponding to the 1700s
	1. would be likely to contain a proportion of red-stained grains closer to 17 percent than to 5 percent.
	1. show a much higher proportion of red-stained grains in cores extracted from the far north of the North Atlantic than in cores extracted from further south.
	1. were formed in part as a result of Gulf Stream waters having been pulled northward

Historians frequently employ *probate* inventories--lists of possessions compiled after a person's death-to estimate standard of living. Because these inventories were taken by amateur *assessors* according to unwritten rules, they are sometimes unreliable. One way to check their accuracy is to compare them to archaeological records. A study of records from the state of Delaware in the eighteenth century found that while very few inventories listed earthenware, every excavation contained earthenware. Earthenware may have gone unlisted simply because it was inexpensive. But if it was so commonplace, why was it listed more often for wealthy households? Perhaps the more earthenware people had, the more likely appraisers were to note it. A few bowls could easily be absorbed into another category, but a roomful of earthenware could not.

6. Select the sentence that provides **support for an answer** to a question in the passage.
	1. Historians frequently ... estimate standard of living

In the 1980s, neuroscientists studying the brain processes underlying our sense of conscious will compared subjects' judgments regarding their subjective will to move (W) and actual movement (M) with objective *electroencephalographic* activity called *readiness potential,* or RP. As expected, **W preceded M**: subjects consciously perceived the intention to move as preceding a conscious experience of actually moving. This might seem to suggest an appropriate correspondence between the sequence of subjective experiences and the sequence of the underlying events in the brain. But researchers actually found a surprising __temporal__ relation between subjective experience and objectively measured neural events: in direct contradiction of the classical conception of free will, neural preparation to **move (RP) preceded conscious awareness of the intention to move (W)** by hundreds of milliseconds.

7. Based on information contained in the passage, which of the following chains of events would most **closely conform** to the **classical conception** of free will?
	1. [O] W *followed by* RP followed by M
	1. RP followed by W followed by M
	1. M followed by W followed by RP
	1. RP followed by M followed by W
	1. RP followed by W and M simultaneously

8. In the context in which it appears, "__temporal__" most nearly means
	1. secular
	1. mundane
	1. numerical
	1. physiological
	1. chronological

9. The author of the passage mentions the classical conception of free will primarily in order to
	1. argue that earlier theories regarding certain brain processes were based on false assumptions
	1. suggest a possible flaw in the reasoning of neuroscientists conducting the study discussed in the passage
	1. provide a possible explanation for the unexpected results obtained by neuroscientists
	1. cast doubt on neuroscientists' conclusions regarding the temporal sequence of brain processes
	1. indicate the reason that the results of the neuroscientists' study were surprising.

Rain-soaked soil contains less oxygen than does drier soil. __The roots of melon plants perform less efficiently under the lowoxygen conditions present in rain-soaked soil.__ When the efficiency of melon roots is impaired, the roots do not supply sufficient amounts of the proper nutrients for the plants to perform photosynthesis at their usual levels. **It follows that** __melon plants have a lower-than-usual rate of photosynthesis when their roots are in rain-soaked soil.__ When the photosynthesis of the plants slows, sugar stored in the fruits is drawn off to supply the plants with energy. **Therefore**, ripe melons harvested after a prolonged period of heavy rain should be less sweet than other ripe melons.
10. In the argument given, the two highlighted portions play which of the following roles?
	1. the first states the conclusion of the argument as a whole, the second provides support for that conclusion.
	1. the first provide support for the conclusion of the argument as a whole, the second provides evidence that support an objection to that conclusion.
	1. the first provide support for an intermediate conclusion that support a further conclusion stated in the argument, the second states that intermediate conclusion.
	1. the first serves as an intermediate conclusion that support a further conclusion stated in the argument, the second states the position that the argument as a whole opposes.
	1. the first states the position that the argument as a whole opposes; the second supports the conclusion of the argument.
