In the 1920s, Gerstmann described a set of problems found in people who have suffered damage to the brain's left *parietal* lobe, problems that include being unable to understand arithmetic and having difficulty identifying one's fingers. There is still no agreement on whether the symptoms Gerstmann noticed constitute a syndrome, but __the parts of the brain used for storing facts about numbers and for representing the fingers are close to each other__. Mental representations of numbers and of fingers may therefore be functionally connected. A __2005 experiment__ had people perform some tasks requiring dexterity and others involving matching pairs of numbers, while an area of their parietal lobes-the left angular *gyrus*-was stimulated by a magnetic field. Facility at both sets of tasks was impaired.

1. The author of the passage would most likely agree that the __highlighted statement__ suggests
	1. a flaw in the experiment conducted in 2005
	1. a means by which dexterity might compensate for a loss of arithmetic ability
	1. an explanation for some of Gerstmann's observations
	1. an anomaly in some of Gerstmann's results
	1. a reason to doubt damage to the left parietal lobe as a causal factor in certain symptoms

2. The author of the passage describes the __"2005 experiment"__ and its results primarily in order to
	1. establish the **proximity between** the part of the brain used for storing numerical information **and** the part used for representing the fingers
	1. **illustrate the implications** that Gerstmann's work may have for experimental research
	1. cast doubt on the idea that damage to the left parietal lobe causes the set of problems that Gerstmann described
	1. support a hypothesis about a significant association between parts of the brain related to fingers and to numbers
	1. suggest that the problems Gerstmann noted in relation to numbers and fingers have a different cause than the other problems associated with parietal lobe damage

**Controversy over the genre of biography** is far from new. **Stanley Fish** recently **dismissed the entire genre**, claiming that because *biographers deal in facts but must supply interpretations of those facts* to create narratives, biographers are, in effect, writing fiction. **Shortly thereafter**, biographer Edmund Morris published his biography of Ronald Reagan, which seems to embrace the idea of biographer as fiction writer: Morris, who had not known Reagan personally, wrote himself into the biography as Reagan's fictional companion and fictionalized many events of Reagan's life as well. Indeed, the practice of inserting imaginary "facts" into biographies to **serve a higher truth has a long history.** Parson Weems's famously apocryphal story of George Washington and the cherry tree, which appeared in the fifth edition (1806) of Weems's The Life and Memorable Actions of George Washington, *canonized* this practice on a popular level. Nineteenth-century scholars such as Jared Sparks denounced such fictions and *spurned* the use in biography of popular lore, even including what we today might call legitimate oral history. Yet Sparks himself modified Washington's grammar and opinions in his emendations of Washington's correspondence, thereby engendering further controversy among critics.

3. The author of the passage refers to Weems's The Life and Memorable Actions of George Washington primarily in order to
	1. provide an example of an author who fictitiously **wrote himself into** a biography long before Morris did so in his biography of Ronald Reagan
	1. support the assertion that the fictionalization of aspects of a subject's life is a long-standing practice within the genre of biography
	1. refute the claim that fictionalized narrative is a necessary component of biographical writing
	1. demonstrate how a biographer's interpretation of historical fact can later be called into question
	1. point out the ways in which popular standards regarding veracity in biographical writing have changed over the past two centuries

4. It can be inferred from the passage that Stanley Fish's opinion of biography as a genre is based on his
	1. assumption that biography is inferior to fiction as a creative genre
	1. disapproval of biographers' tendency to pass judgment on their biographical subjects
	1. disapproval of the methods that most present-day biographers use to research their biographical subjects
	1. belief that the integrity of the genre has declined markedly since the early nineteenth century
	1. [O] belief that biographical narrative can never be a strictly factual account of the subject's life

5. It can be inferred from the passage that Sparks disapproved of Weems's The Life and Memorable Actions of George Washington because of which of the following?
	1. The book's distortion of oral history
	1. The book's violation of time-honored biographical traditions
	1. Weems's tendency to *pander* to popular opinion
	1. Weems's misinterpretation of Washington's opinions
	1. [O] Weems's inclusion of a fictional episode

Professor:A manuscript described by an auction house as the **draft of an unknown Thomas Hardy novel** set in southwestern England **is unlikely to be authentic**. In his published novels, Hardy always used the same fictional names for actual towns in southwestern England; for instance, Exeter was always called Exonbury. Yet in the manuscript for sale **several clearly identifiable towns have fictional names different from the names they were standardly given in Hardy's published novels.**

6. Which of the following, if true, most **strengthens** the professor's argument?
	1. Hardy was very reluctant to allow anyone access to papers pertaining to works in progress.
	1. The manuscript being auctioned was written before the publication date of Hardy's first published novel.
	1. All of the towns mentioned in the manuscript are clearly identifiable as fictional counterparts of towns in southwestern England.
	1. Drafts of some of Hardy's novels were written several years before the final, published version.
	1. [O] Authenticated drafts of Hardy's known novels all use the same place-names as appeared in the published novels.

United States women won the vote in 1920 after decades of campaigning. **Yet, the impact on women's status was more limited than women's rights activists had anticipated.** Women were granted suffrage at a historical point when voting was no longer a significant political activity for many Americans. In the mid-nineteenth century, when women first sought suffrage rights, voter *turnout rates* were unprecedentedly high, elections in much of the country very competitive, and political parties important. **But when women finally received the vote in 1920, electoral politics was largely noncompetitive**, with virtual one-party rule in many areas, and voter turnout had slipped to its all-time low. **Nonetheless, the vote still mattered enough** for women to seek it and for conservatives to try to restrict its availability

7. The passage suggests which of the following about women's achievement of voting rights?
	1. It had a negative impact on voter turnout rates after 1920.
	1. It was considered by many women to have little impact on women's political status.
	1. It was responsible for a major shift in the way most Americans perceived the importance of voting.
	1. It would have had more political impact if it had occurred earlier than it did.
	1. It might have occurred earlier if political parties had not been so strong in the mid-nineteenth century.

8. The author of the passage **discusses voter turnout rates** primarily in order to
	1. confirm an assumption about **the impact of woman suffrage** on United States electoral politics
	1. [O] explain a significant change in American political life that occurred over the course of the campaign for woman suffrage
	1. account for changes in the importance of **political parties** between the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
	1. identify a reason elections were less **competitive after 1920 than** they had been in earlier decades
	1. illustrate a point about the importance of p**olitical parties** in the mid-nineteenth century

In eighteenth-century Europe, religious art remained, as a branch of history painting, theoretically unchallenged at the head of the hierarchy of painting. Below came *portraiture*, *genre painting*, landscape, and still life. But **this ranking must be seen against the background** of an explosion in the art market with the beginning of public exhibitions, technological developments permitting the mass production of prints, and the spread of wealth among the middle classes in western Europe. **It was the minor fields that experienced the real expansion.** Partly because of the new interest in human psychology, portraiture flourished on an unprecedented scale, and the scale of patronage was expanded by the desire of the rich in the middle ranks of society to have their status confirmed by art.

9. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. discuss changes affecting certain artistic fields in eighteenth-century Europe
	1. argue for the **superiority of one style** of painting over others in eighteenth-century European art
	1. resolve a **controversy** regarding changing hierarchies in eighteenth-century European painting
	1. show how **technological advances** in eighteenth-century Europe altered the production of art
	1. explain the **origins** of certain new artistic fields in eighteenth-century Europe
	
10. The passage implies which of the following about eighteenth-century European portraiture?
	1. It was often **shunned** by the upper ranks of society because of its association with the middle classes.
	1. It was sometimes employed to reinforce the social status of certain patrons.
	1. It offered the middle classes their **first opportunity** to play an active role in shaping aesthetic standards.
	1. It was **easier** to obtain patronage for this field of painting than for religious art.
	1. It was generally **less expensive** to purchase than was religious art.
