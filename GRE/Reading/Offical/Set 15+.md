## Questions

Angel DeCora, the best-known Native American artist in the United States before World War I, is rarely discussed by __early historians of Native American art__. These historians valued what they considered **authenticity, defined as an absence of modern and European influences.** DeCora was educated by some of the country's leading European American artists, and she used European elements such as vanishing-point perspective to depict Native American subjects. Hutchinson argues that this should not preclude DeCora's work from being considered Native American art. She suggests that by representing the intersection between Native American and European American culture, **DeCora's work challenged the European American view of Native American culture** as belonging only to the past, presenting instead an image of survival and adaptation.

1. It can be inferred that Hutchinson would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements about Native American art?
	1. It is unlikely to develop further in the direction charted by Angel DeCora.
	1. It has been misrepresented by art historians who apply European criteria to art that was not intended to reflect European aesthetic values.
	1. It is most authentic when it uses traditional Native American methods to depict traditional Native American subject matter.
	1. It has traditionally used European elements in ways that differ from the use that European American artists make of those elements.
	1. It can adopt new elements in response to changing cultural conditions and still remain Native American art.

2. The passage suggests which of the following about the "early historians of Native American art" mentioned in the passage?
	1. Their views of Native American art were strongly influenced by Native American' criteria for determining whether art authentically represented their cultures.
	1. Their criteria for judging the authenticity of Native American art gave *primacy* to subject matter over technique.
	1. They included in histories of Native American art only works created prior to the period of Native Americans' contact with Europeans.
	1. [O] They would regard the use of vanishing-point perspective as an inauthentic element in a painting by a Native American artist.
	1. They were probably familiar with Angel DeCora's art but unaware that she was Native American.

Herman Melville's description of the social arrangement of sperm whales in Moby-Dick is remarkably similar to others' description of more familiar **mammals, where males dominate a group of females, fight off interloping males, and breed with the females in the *harem*.** **This arrangement is found in a variety of mammals**, including such diverse species as elephant seals, elk, lions, and even chimpanzees, **but it does not apply to sperm whales.** __Would you really expect sperm whales, different in almost every respect from all other mammals, to conform to some sort of behavioral norm?__ Of course not, and they don't, but there is a surprising similarity to another huge mammal. In what they call "A Colossal Convergence," Weilgart, Whitehead, and Payne describe the **remarkable similarities between** the sperm whale, the largest toothed whale, and the largest terrestrial mammal, **the African elephant** (Loxodonta africana). Just as sperm whales are able to __communicate over long distances__, so too can elephants. Females announce their availability for breeding by sending out a series of low-pitched calls, and reproductively receptive males converge from all directions. Elephant calls, far below the range of human hearing, also serve to attract distant family members to the scene of excitement, distress, or separation. **Elephants and sperm whales have unusual but remarkably similar life** history parameters, wide-ranging behavior, and ecological success, as well as the largest brains, respectively, on land and in the ocean. **Their societies are based on *matrilineal* groups** of about ten related females that often form temporary associations, of a few days or so, with other female groups. After leaving their mother's group when they are about six years old, male sperm whales become increasingly solitary and range to higher latitudes as they grow to about one and a half times the length and three times the weight of females-the most extreme case of sexual size *dimorphism* among cetaceans. **Another striking parallel with elephants is in the delayed age of effective breeding by males**: although male elephants and sperm whales become sexually mature during their late teens, they do not seem to take a significant role in breeding until their late twenties. In the case of elephants, this is because younger males do not enter the behaviorally dominant but physiologically demanding state of musth [a periodic condition characterized by heightened aggression] in the prime breeding season. Male sperm whales in the same age range usually remain in productive high-latitude waters, away from the tropical breeding grounds of the females. In these highly sexually dimorphic species, it probably pays younger males to concentrate on growth rather than competing with their much larger elders for the few breeding opportunities presented by slowly reproducing females, who might bear one young every four or five years.

3. The passage suggests that which of the following is one way in which the social groups of elephant seals, elk, lions, and chimpanzees differ from those of sperm whales and elephants?
	1. The level of communication within the group
	1. [O] The extent of the presence of dominant adult males in the group
	1. The number of adult females in the group
	1. The degree of relatedness among the females in the group
	1. The migratory behavior of the group

4. The __highlighted sentence__ serves primarily to
	1. [O] *contextualize* the distinctiveness of sperm whales' social arrangements
	1. emphasize the unreliability of literary accounts of sperm whales
	1. contrast how little is known of sperm whales with how much is known of other mammals
	1. introduce a paradox about mammalian social behavior that the author goes on to develop
	1. present a question about sperm whales' behavior that the passage sets out to answer

	1. the size of typical social groups
	1. their brain size
	1. the frequency with which individual females reproduce
	1. the age at which young males leave the *maternal* group
	1. the age of effective breeding by males

6. Based on the passage, the author would most likely agree with which of the following statements about the ability __"to communicate over long distances"__?
	1. It serves all the same functions among sperm whales as it does among African elephants.
	1. It is more highly developed in females than in males of both sperm whales and African elephants.
	1. It is somewhat more developed in sperm whales than it is in African elephants.
	1. It allows sexually mature male sperm whales to *disperse* but remain in contact with one another.
	1. [O] It enables the formation of groups of sperm whales in which the only sexually mature permanent members are female.

Much of the world's cultivable land has high concentrations of aluminum in the soil. Because aluminum in soil can form compounds that damage grain plants' roots and drastically reduce yields, crop scientists are eager to find strains of grains that are aluminum tolerant. Finding a population of grain plants **growing in aluminum-rich soil but producing high yields does not necessarily indicate that the plants belong to an aluminum-tolerant strain**, however, since __________.

7. Which of the following most logically completes the passage?
	1. even where the damaging aluminum compounds are absent, grain plants still require a variety of nutrients in order to yield well
	1. high concentrations of some metallic elements other than aluminum can also damage grain plants' roots
	1. the soil of some agricultural regions contains virtually no aluminum
	1. any such population might have other unusual characteristics
	1. [O] the damaging aluminum compounds do not form unless the soil is acidic

According to Hill and Spicer, the term "*nation-state"* is a misnomer, since the ideal model of a *monolingual*, **culturally homogeneous state has never existed**, not even among Europeans, who invented the nation-state concept and introduced it to the rest of the world. Modern European states, they argue, emerged after the Renaissance through the rise of nations (i.e., specific ethnic groups) to positions of political and economic dominance over a number of other ethnic groups within the bounded political territories. The term "nation-state", Hill and Spicer argue, **obscures the internal cultural and linguistic diversity** of states that could more **accurately be called "conquest states."** The resurgence of multiple ethnic groups within a single state, Hill says, is not **"potentially threating to the sovereign jurisdiction of the state," as Urban and Sherzer suggest**; rather, the *assertion* of cultural differences threatens to reveal ethnocentric beliefs and practices upon which conquest states were historically founded and thus to open up the possibility for a "nations-state" in which conquered ethnic groups enjoy equal rights with the conquering ethnic group but do not face the threat of persecution or cultural assimilation into the dominant ethnic group.

8. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. discuss issues relating to a form of political organization by raising doubts about the terminology used to refer to it
	1. trace changes in a form of political organization by examining the evolution of the terminology used to refer to
	1. justify the continued use of an established term for an evolving form of political organization
	1. question the accuracy of a new term for a form of political organization
	1. compare two terms for a form of political organization

9. The author of the passage **quotes Urban and Sherzer** most probably in order to
	1. introduce a discussion of the legal ramifications of expanding the nation-state concept
	1. [O] summarize a claim about one possible effect of asserting cultural differences within a state
	1. shift the focus of discussion from internal threats that states face to external threats that they face
	1. point out similarities between the threats to states seen by Urban and Sherzer and those seen by Hill
	1. describe one way an ethnocentric practice has affected attempts to assert cultural differences within a state

10. According to the passage, Hill and Spicer define nations as which of the following?
	1. coalitions of distinct ethnic groups with similar concerns
	1. Distinct ethnic groups
	1. Culturally homogeneous states
	1. Linguistically diverse states
	1. Territorially bounded states

6. 推理题
	5. 题目问作者最可能同意的关于长距离交流的陈述，根据关键词定位到二段，可知长距离交流能让雌性召唤远方的雄性。结合三段，可知抹香鲸社群有母系组成，长大的雄性会离开社群。综合可知E选项，长距离沟通能力使得只有成年雌性组成社群成为可能。

8. 主旨题，文章介绍Hill and Spicer关于民族国家的观点。开头说他们对“nation-state”的质疑，接着展开它们质疑的理由：历史上，民族国家即使在欧洲也不存在。他们认为，该概念模糊了国家内部文化语言的多样性。他们认为“conquest states”概念更准确。对于现在的问题，他们认为，多样族群的重新出现不是威胁，而是成为被征服族群和征服族群享有平等机会多民族国家（“nations-state”）的好机会。
	4. new term不准确，作者並無提及 new 一詞

9. 目的题
