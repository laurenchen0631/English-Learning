## Questions

The literature of the American West ranges from lowbrow entertainment to great works of fiction. The extremes are obvious enough, but **the middle tends to blur**. The *dime*-store *Western* never aspired to be anything but entertainment. James Fenimore Cooper and Willa Cather, however, used themes of westward expansion in works clearly intended as highbrow literature. The novels of modern writer Larry McMurtry broke new ground: He took the Western and created a great piece of fiction, without changing its fundamental genre appeal or its accessibility to the general reader.

As an example of his *retooling* of the Western genre, consider McMurtry's themes. While the Western myth is fundamentally about resettlement to new lands. McMurtry's novels **combine elements of the Western myth with less traditional motifs: profound reluctance to face change**, conflict between urbanization and the Western ideal, the importance of place, and the role of the land itself. While the traditional Western is rooted in the past, McMurtry's themes combine nostalgia for that past with a sense of emptiness in the present and hopelessness for the future.

Or consider McMurtry's treatment of character. The traditional Western formula depicts mainly masculine characters and portrays them as both heroic and human. In his novels, McMurtry creates strong female characters, transmuting the conventional plot of the trials and dangers of the frontier by folding in deeper ideological insights. Critics rightly credit his novels with reshaping the Western genre, praising his work and its meticulous attention to the Western mise en scene as a subversive but sincere *tribute* to the American West.

1. __Consider each of the following answer choices separately and select all that apply.__ According to the passage, the **ideological undertones** in McMurtry's novels stem from the
	1. introduction of strong female characters
	1. portrayal of the dangerous nature of the Western frontier
	1. subversive nature of the writing

2. It can be inferred that the author regards McMurtry's treatment of character with
	1. **regret** because McMurtry did not adhere to Western novelistic conventions
	1. **concern** that the characterizations altered the nature of the Western formula
	1. approval for the manner in which their inclusion transformed the Western genre
	1. puzzlement, because the characters seem insignificant to the plot
	1. **enthusiasm**, because the characters reform the conventionality of Western plots

3. Select the sentence that shows the author's view of McMurtry's treatment of gender.
	- In his novels, McMurtry creates strong female characters, transmuting the conventional plot of the trials and dangers of the frontier by folding in deeper ideological insights.

4. The author refers to James Fenimore Cooper and Willa Cather in order to suggest
	1. that their works are examples of entertaining literature
	1. that their literary achievements were no less impressive than those of McMurtry
	1. [O] that the themes of the Western genre could be employed in literature meant to appeal to a more sophisticated reader
	1. that they were contemporaries of McMurtry
	1. that the theme of westward expansion was a multicultural concept

"*Hydrothermal vent*" is the term that scientists use to describe a crack in a planet's surface from which geothermally heated water emerges. Because these vents are common in places that are volcanically active, they are plentiful on Earth. While the most famous hydrothermal vent is probably the geyser at Yellowstone National Park in the United States, there are several different types of vents, existing both on land and underwater. Black Smokers, for instance, are a common type of submarine vent. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration first discovered these in the vicinity of *the Galapagos Islands* in 1977. Underwater vents such as these form when water that has been heated by magma beneath the earth's crust exits through cracks in the ocean floor. Scientists are interested in these vents primarily for their ability to host biologically dense communities in areas that are otherwise hostile to life. Studies show that *Chemosynthetic* *archaea*, a life form similar to bacteria, allows these areas to support such diverse organisms as clams and *shrimp*. Black Smokers are also visually striking. Minerals in the water that emerge from the earth's crust crystallize around each vent to create their distinctive black *chimney*-like formations.

While on a vessel exploring the Atlantis *Massif* in the mid-Atlantic Ridge, scientists recently discovered a completely new kind of hydrothermal system, which they dubbed "Lost City." Here, a "forest" of white limestone pillars rises 180 feet above the sea floor. **There are several important differences that distinguish the hydrothermal vents in Lost City from the more familiar Black Smokers.** The heat and fluid flow at Lost City is driven by the intermingling of seawater and mantle rocks on the sea floor, rather than by hot magma. As these fluids mix with magnesium-rich sea water, they deposit calcium carbonate and *magnesium* *hydroxide*, thereby creating the stunning white structures of Lost City. The fluids here are also much cooler (less than 100 degrees Celsius) and are composed of substances and gases that are different from those of Black Smokers. For instance, the fluids here have high pH content and contain significant amounts of hydrogen and *methane* gas.

The discovery of Lost City is still a fairly recent one. and scientists currently have more questions than answers. However, they hope that the insights they gain from this study will provide information that will **lead to a better understanding of some of the earliest hydrothermal systems on earth and the life they supported.**

5. Select the sentence that explains why Black Smokers have *piqued* the curiosity of biologists.
	- Scientists are interested in these vents primarily for their ability to host biologically dense communities in areas that are otherwise hostile to life.

6. __Consider each of the following answer choices separately and select all that apply.__ The passage suggests that the hydrothermal vents that constitute Lost City are different from Black Smokers in which of the following ways?
	1. [O] Magma propels the heat and water of Black Smokers, whereas the vents at Lost City are driven by the merging of seawater and mantle rocks.
	1. Black Smoker vents release water that is much cooler than the water released at Lost City.
	1. Chemosynthetic archaea fosters many different life forms around Black Smokers but is not present at Lost City.

7. __Consider each of the following answer choices separately and select all that apply__. According to the passage, which of the following statements are true about Black Smokers
	1. As water emerges from the vents it deposits calcium carbonate.
	1. Black chimney-like structures form around each vent.
	1. Black Smokers host biologically dense communities.

8. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. refute a well-established theory
	1. describe a newly discovered natural phenomenon and compare it to another
	1. explain how the study of a certain natural phenomenon has changed over time
	1. evaluate opposing theories
	1. reconsider a natural phenomenon in light of new discoveries

Though artist Chuck Close has devoted his life to portraiture, his paintings rarely *comport* with that genre's traditional purpose. His early *photorealist* images, which are created by overlaying a grid on a photograph and painstakingly copying the image cell by cell, are, to the naked eye. nearly undifferentiable from photographs. Furthermore, **Close's emphasis is on the disembodied head itself, expressionless and devoid of any overt personality**. He has never acceded to commissions, relying on both his own image and his friends as models. In 1988. a collapsed spinal artery caused almost total paralysis, but Close has continued to work. His freer paintings evince a natural extension of an augmented interest in the minute grid over the total work that predated his illness. This **nonprivileging of any particular part of the canvas finds its inspiration, oddly enough, in abstract expressionism,** despite the apparent *inconsonance* of the two techniques.

9. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ Which of the following statements are supported by the passage?
	1. Close's portraits are so realistic that they are sometimes mistaken for photographs.
	1. [?] There are conceptual connections between Close's later work and other, apparently dissimilar works.
	1. Throughout his career as an artist, none of the portraits Close has painted have been done in exchange for money.

10. What is the author's intent when discussing Close's focus on the head of his subjects?
	1. The author compares the artistic impact of photographs of heads to that of abstract photographs of the same head.
	1. The author ruminates on wThat early experiences led to Close's focus on the head as a unifying theme in his work.
	1. The author expounds upon how, by not accepting commissions. Close's wTork has remained free of commercial influences.
	1. The author deconstructs the impact that Close's illness had on the content of his paintings.
	1. [O] The author believes that Close's approach of depicting the head but none of the personality of the subject is rare.

The increasing pressure on American businesses to pursue cost-cutting measures will eventually lead to an increase in the outsourcing of business processes to *venues* with lower *overhead*, such as India. However, this shift may not provide the dramatic gains for American business that might have been expected by an enterprise with an ethos for change that is oriented to preserving bottom-line profits. **The difficulty is that a significant portion of American society remains uncomfortable with shifting business tasks overseas.** Therefore, American businesses will predominantly opt for outsourcing opportunities for repetitive tasks that can easily be brought back to the United States if necessary. Nevertheless, opportunities for Indian firms to get a larger piece of the pie seem certain to arise. The growing emphasis on bringing down the cost of *back-office operations* is bound to offer increasing scope for Indian firms to become involved in novel types of ever more complex business processes.

11. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ According the passage, despite the increasing pressure on American businesses to pursue cost-cutting measures, certain other factors preclude
	1. [O] Indian firms` performing all of the business processes currently being performed onshore by American businesses.
	1. [O] American businesses committing to outsourcing jobs overseas.
	1. Indian firms` outsourcing more complex tasks to American firms in order to create an interconnected hierarchy of business needs.

12. Select the sentence in which the author specifies a characteristic of jobs likely to be outsourced.
	- Therefore, American businesses will predominantly opt for outsourcing opportunities for repetitive tasks that can easily be brought back to the United States if necessary.

13. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. present an overview of the different types of business opportunities available to Indian firms
	1. [?] present a reasoned prognosis of the business opportunities that may become available to Indian firms
	1. present the trend toward outsourcing business operations as **a model case** of business operations in action
	1. analyze how opportunities available to Indian firms were necessitated by an increasing number of American firms
	1. analyze the use of cost-cutting measures as a substitute for outsourcing in the new American business climate

Scientists are **growing increasingly concerned that coral**, which grows abundantly in the circumtropical shallow waters near bodies of land, is evincing **a paling, or bleaching effect**. Though experts are still *at odds over* what has precipitated this event, most agree that it is a stress response to changes in habitat and water quality, including temperature variations and salination percentage, and predict a loss of 95 percent of existing coral populations. An exemplary symbiotic entity, *scleractinian coral* lives harmoniously with vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. Corals receive nutrients in two ways: by capturing planktonic organisms with *nematocyst-capped* *tentacles* and by resource-sharing and recycling with single-celled algae called *zooxanthellae*. These algae live within the *polyps* of the coral, using photosynthesis to increase (and thereby strengthen) coral calcification and providing energy for coral growth. The zooxanthellae benefit from the relationship through protection from predators and a steady supply of necessary carbon dioxide. Interestingly, it is the zooxanthellae that provide coral with its brilliant coloration. When coral loses its color, it is a sign that the single-celled algae are not able to thrive. Though not necessarily a sign of mortality, a pale, wan color indicates imminent danger and is considered a stress response. The zooxanthellate invertebrates lose their concentration of pigmentation or die altogether when stressed, turning translucent and allowing the slightly darker coral skeleton to show through the decaying tissue. Whether this response stems from *anthropogenic* pollutions such as overharvesting coral for the exotic travel market, overfishing coral waters, and increased water temperatures due to global warming, or from natural disturbances (storms, temperature extremes, and diseases), scientists fear for the future of the radiant corals. If zooxanthellate populations continue to decrease without recovery, their host corals will eventually follow suit, triggering a cascade of unanticipated biological events.

14. The author attributes the pollution cited as being detrimental to coral to
	1. overpopulation by large sea mammals, such as dolphins
	1. activities of humans
	1. purely accidental causes which cannot be influenced
	1. overpopulation by photosynthetic archaebacteria
	1. natural phenomena, such as changes in weather

15. Select the sentence from the third paragraph that explains why zooxanthellae lose their coloration.
	- The zooxanthellate invertebrates lose their concentration of pigmentation or die altogether when stressed, turning translucent and allowing the slightly darker coral skeleton to show through the decaying tissue.

16. It can be inferred from the passage that which of the following situations is a possible contributing factor to coral bleaching?
	1. The proliferation of large-scale freight ships in circumtropical regions
	1. Modern civilization`s dependence on fossil fuels
	1. Tourists` demand for coral souvenirs
	1. Governmental apathy due to more pressing problems
	1. Coral`s unusual sensitivity to the *vagaries* of natural climate changes

17. It can be inferred from the passage that zooxanthellae are
	1. able to use camouflage to blend into their surroundings
	1. dependent on carbon dioxide
	1. unable to live without coral hosts
	1. considered parasitical to coral
	1. unnecessary for the continued survival of coral
