## Questions

The literature of the American West ranges from lowbrow entertainment to great works of fiction. The extremes are obvious enough, but **the middle tends to blur**. The *dime*-store *Western* never aspired to be anything but entertainment. James Fenimore Cooper and Willa Cather, however, used themes of westward expansion in works clearly intended as highbrow literature. The novels of modern writer Larry McMurtry broke new ground: He took the Western and created a great piece of fiction, without changing its fundamental genre appeal or its accessibility to the general reader.

As an example of his *retooling* of the Western genre, consider McMurtry's themes. While the Western myth is fundamentally about resettlement to new lands. McMurtry's novels **combine elements of the Western myth with less traditional motifs: profound reluctance to face change**, conflict between urbanization and the Western ideal, the importance of place, and the role of the land itself. While the traditional Western is rooted in the past, McMurtry's themes combine nostalgia for that past with a sense of emptiness in the present and hopelessness for the future.

Or consider McMurtry's treatment of character. The traditional Western formula depicts mainly masculine characters and portrays them as both heroic and human. In his novels, McMurtry creates strong female characters, transmuting the conventional plot of the trials and dangers of the frontier by folding in deeper ideological insights. Critics rightly credit his novels with reshaping the Western genre, praising his work and its meticulous attention to the Western mise en scene as a subversive but sincere *tribute* to the American West.
