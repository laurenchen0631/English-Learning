In 1798, economist Thomas Robert Malthus stated in his "Essay on the Principle of Population" that "population increases in a geometric ratio, while the means of subsistence increases in an arithmetic ratio." However, Malthuss **dire prediction of a precipitous decline in the worlds population** has not come to pass. The miscalculations in what has come to be known as the Malthus Doctrine are partly due to Malthuss **inability to foresee the innovations that allowed vast increases in worldwide wheat production.**

In the late nineteenth century, the invention of the tractor *staved off* a Malthusian disaster. While the first tractors were not particularly powerful, the replacement of animals by machinery meant that land that had been devoted to hay and oats could now be reclaimed for growth of crops for human consumption. Nevertheless, the Malthusian limit might still have been reached if crop yield had not been increased.

A natural way to increase crop yield is to supply the soil with additional nitrogen. In 1909, chemist Fritz Haber succeeded in combining nitrogen and hydrogen to make ammonia, the white powder version of which, when added to the soil, improves wheat production. Haber nitrogen, however, was not widely used until later in the twentieth century, largely due to **farmers resistance to spreading an unnatural substance on their crops**. Habers invention had a f**urther drawback**: If applied in incorrect quantities, the wheat crop would grow taller and thicker, eventually toppling over and rotting.

Interestingly, in the late twentieth century the discovery of **genetic engineering**, which provides a means of increasing rice and maize production, **met with equal resistance**, this time **from the environmental movement**. Even without direct genetic engineering, it is likely that science will discover new methods to improve agricultural production.

1. According to the passage, which is of the following is true about Haber nitrogen?
	1. Haber nitrogen is **more** effective at increasing the yield of wheat crops than that of maize or oat crops.
	1. Undesired effects can result from the application of surplus quantities of Haber nitrogen.
	1. Haber nitrogen was the **first** non-naturally occurring substance to be applied to crops as fertilizer.
	1. Haber nitrogen may not be effective if applied at an **improper time** in wheat`s growth cycle.
	1. **Farmers were quick to adopt** Haber nitrogen because it made their crops grow taller and thicker.

2. The passage **implies** all of the following __EXCEPT__
	1. world food production has kept pace with world population growth
	1. technological innovation is one factor that allowed for an increase in crop production
	1. farmers are not the only group that has opposed artificial efforts to increase crop yield.
	1. the Malthusian limit might well have been reached if new methods to increase crop production had not been found
	1. [O] a Malthusian disaster would have been ensured if it were not for the invention of genetic engineering
