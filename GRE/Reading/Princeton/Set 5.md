The *wombat* is a muscular *quadruped*, about 3 feet in length with a short tail. The animal, which is not a mythical creature but an Australian marsupial, has a name derived from the language of the native peoples of the Sydney area, the Eora aboriginals. Wombats are herbivores and leave cubic *scats* that are easily recognized. Because wombats are seldom seen, attributed to the fact that they are nocturnal, the scats provide crucial evidence regarding territory. This large, burrowing mammal is not related to the badger, whose habits are similar. In fact, the koala is the wombat's closest relative. The principal burrowing *instrument* of the latter is its incisors which, like those of other rodents with orange *enamel*, are never worn down. Burrows can be extensive and shared by more than one wombat, despite the generally solitary nature of the creature. Territories within the burrow are marked by scent, vocalizations, and aggressive displays.

1. The author states that the wombat is an Australian marsupial in order to
	1. describe the role of stories about the wombat as part of the Eora's oral tradition
	1. [O] dispel the belief of some people that the wombat is not a real animal
	1. create parallels between the Eora culture and the mythology of the ancient Greeks
	1. contrast the behavior of wombats with that of other rodents
	1. undermine the validity of research surrounding naming standards

2. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ According to the passage, which of the following is **NOT** true regarding wombats and their territory?
	1. [O] Scats are the only way to determine territorial limits of wombats.
	1. The question of how much territory a wombat covers is of interest to some people.
	1. [O] Wombats are generally not territorial about the space they occupy within their burrows.

The controversial concept of terraforming, or changing a planet's atmosphere to make it more habitable for humans, is still no more than a theoretical debate. However, the most recent data from two American Mars Rovers suggest that the terraforming of Mars may be more feasible than previously thought. The rovers found evidence of stratification patterns and cross bedding (indicating a history of sediment deposited by water) in rocks on the edges of craters, as well as *chlorine* and *bromine*, suggestive of a large body of salt water. If Mars once held water, it is possible that its atmosphere was at one time somewhat similar to Earth's. Even if this theory were true, however, scientists would have to prevent a recurrence of the desiccation of the Martian atmosphere once it is made habitable, as well as endeavor to preserve any extant life. Of course, until a reliable method of transporting humans to Mars is developed, any possibility of terraforming is mere conjecture.

3. Which of the following statements, if true, would most likely make terraforming Mars more feasible?
	1. Scientists have devised a technique to provide a layer of carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere, which would trap solar radiation an temperature.
	1. Mars has stronger solar winds than does Earth, thus, making it difficult to retain atmospheric gases.
	1. Mars' core has cooled faster than Earth's, and its temperature is much lower than Earth's.
	1. Terraforming Mars is likely to have a galvanizing effect on Earth's governments.
	1. Terraforming Mars is unlikely to disturb life on other planets, should it exist.

4. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements?
	1. [O] whether conditions on Mars are conducive to human habitation is not the only issue that limits realistic consideration of terraforming.
	1. [?] If we terraform Mars, it will be important to think about the long-term effects of changing a planet's climate.
	1. it is highly likely, according to recent data, that there is, or was at one time, life on Mars.

**The determination of the age of KNM-ER 1470, a humanoid skull**, would add greatly to our knowledge of mammalian evolution. Anthropologists originally dated the habilis skull at **3 million years old. This age seemed unlikely** because it was older than the age of any known *australopithecines*. which are presumed to be the habilis's ancestor. Further attempts to date the skull have led to speculative results.

An elemental property of all living things is that they contain a certain portion of their carbon as the radioactive isotope carbon-14. Carbon-14 is created when solar radiation blasts nuclei in the upper atmosphere, in turn producing neutrons that bombard nitrogen-14 at lower altitudes, turning it into carbon-14. All living things maintain an equilibrium of carbon-14 as they exchange carbon with their surrounding atmosphere. **Presuming the rate of production to be constant, the activity of a sample can be compared to the equilibrium activity of living matter, and thus the age can be calculated.** However, carbon-14 decays at a half-life of 5730 years, **limiting age determinations to the order of 50.000 years.** This time frame can be extended to perhaps 100,000 years using accelerator techniques. Even so, at these ages carbon dating is increasingly **unreliable as a result of changes in the carbon-isotope mix**. Over the last century, the burning of fossil fuels, which have no carbon-14 content, have had a diluting effect on the atmospheric carbon-14. As a *countervailing* effect, atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1950s may well have doubled the atmosphere's carbon-14 content.

Other radiometric dating methods, using relative concentrations of parent-daughter products in radio decay changes of other elements, such as argon, may prove to be of greater benefit for dating such ancient samples as habilis. However, **the assumption that the decay rates of these isotopes have always been constant** would first have to be substantiated.

5. The author first mentions the half-life of carbon in order to
	1. provide a reason why carbon dating techniques fail to give an age for the habilis skull
	1. explain the success of carbon dating techniques
	1. illustrate the difference between carbon dating and other techniques
	1. show the need for extending carbon dating results with accelerator techniques
	1. illustrate the carbon equilibrium that all living things maintain

6. What can be inferred about the proposed solution mentioned in the final paragraph?
	1. Continued experimentation with nuclear weapons could restore the expected carbon-14 content to the atmosphere to ensure accuracy of carbon dating.
	1. Alternatives to fossil fuels should be pursued to prevent further interference with carbon dating procedures.
	1. Decay rates of isotopes involved in radiometric methods need to be invariable.
	1. Carbon-14 levels could be artificially restored to previous historical levels to allow an appropriate basis of comparison.
	1. Appropriate technology to implement radiometric methods needs to be engineered.

7. Select the sentence in the passage in which the author raises a possible objection to proposed alternatives to carbon dating.
	- However, the assumption that the decay rates of these isotopes have always been constant would first have to be substantiated.

8. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The author suggests that the burning of fossil fuels has had which of the following effects on the efficacy of carbon dating techniques?
	1. It may increase the carbon-isotope mix of the object being dated.
	1. [O] It may make items subjected to carbon dating appear to have died later than is the case.
	1. It may tilt the fragile equilibrium activity of living matter.

## Review
8. 注意稀释的是大气中C14的浓度，而不是要测量标本体内的。 计算标本年龄的时候，要用衰变后的C14浓度减去存活时的C14.得到一个浓度差，根据半衰期即可得到该标本有多久远。而存活时的C14就是大气C14浓度（生物体与大气保一直交换保持平衡）。这样，当原始生物体C14降低（被稀释），浓度差减少，计算得到生物体距今比较接近。(later)
