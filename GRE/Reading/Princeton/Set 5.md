The wombat is a muscular quadruped, about 3 feet in length with a short tail. The animal, which is not a mythical creature but an Australian marsupial, has a name derived from the language of the native peoples of the Sydney area, the Eora aboriginals. Wombats are herbivores and leave cubic scats that are easily recognized. Because wombats are seldom seen, attributed to the fact that they are nocturnal, the scats provide crucial evidence regarding territory. This large, burrowing mammal is not related to the badger, whose habits are similar. In fact, the koala is the wombat's closest relative. The principal burrowing instrument of the latter is its incisors which, like those of other rodents with orange enamel, are never worn down. Burrows can be extensive and shared by more than one wombat, despite the generally solitary nature of the creature. Territories within the burrow are marked by scent, vocalizations, and aggressive displays.
