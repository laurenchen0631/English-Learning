## Questions

It has frequently been argued that freeing schools from the rigid rules, regulations, and statutes that have traditionally fettered them would have a revolutionary effect on academic achievement. For instance, it has been suggested that schools embodying this idea could develop more effective teaching methods that could then be replicated in other schools. *Charter schools*-public schools that operate under a contract, or "charter"-were given just such an opportunity beginning in 1991, when Minnesota passed the first charter school law. At that time, many critics warned of deleterious rather than beneficial effects that such *freewheeling* schools could have on the academic achievement of students. Thus, while public opinion differed concerning the social desirability of charter schools, most agreed that there would be a pronounced effect.

Surprisingly, educators who study educational reform now seriously question the degree to which charter schools have made an impact. **They conclude that freedom** from many of the policies and regulations affecting traditional public schools and the *concomitant* control over decisions that guide the day-to-day affairs of the school **have not resulted in equally dramatic changes in students' academic performance.** In some states, charter schools are less likely to meet state performance standards than traditional public schools. It is, however, impossible to know whether this difference is due to the performance of the schools, the prior achievement of the students, or some other factor.

Metrics for educational *accountability* have changed considerably in the past decade, moving increasingly to performance as measured by state mandated tests of individual student achievement. Fundamentally, however, the challenging conditions under which schools operate, be they traditional or charter, have changed little: the struggle for resources, low pay for teachers, accountability to multiple stakeholders, and the difficulty of meeting the educational requirements of children with special needs all persist.

1. Select the sentence from the second paragraph that best explains why author neither dismisses nor endorses the opinion of the critics of charter schools.
	- It is, however, impossible to know whether this difference is due to the performance of the schools, the prior achievement of the students, or some other factor.

2. In the last paragraph the author mentions all of the following as challenges faced by all schools EXCEPT
	1. the difficulty of securing capital
	1. the challenge of providing appropriate conditions for special-needs students
	1. the necessity to answer to different interest groups
	1. the manner in which student performance is measured
	1. poor *compensation* for teachers

3. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ It can be inferred from the passage that the author would consider which of the following, **if true, a likely indication of a fundamental alteration** in education brought about by charter schools?
	1. Statistics show that the majority of children who attended charter schools in the 1990s are attending or have attended college.
	1. A national standard of academic performance, to which all students in every type of school must adhere, is created.
	1. [O] A consistent score improvement in state-mandated tests has been achieved by children who attend charter schools, but not by those who attend traditional schools.

According to scholars, the indigenous peoples of ancient Mesoamerica, specifically the Nahuas, developed a rich and complex philosophy comprising four interrelated and overlapping branches of knowledge: metaphysics, epistemology, theory of value, and aesthetics. At **the core of their philosophy was teotl**, which, rather than an immutable supernatural being like the Judaeo-Christian deity, was an ever-moving and ever-changing, self-producing sacred power that animated the universe and its contents. **It was responsible for all things in nature - animals, rocks, rain, and so on - and permeated the details of everything.** There was no distinction between teotl and the natural world; teotl was in every entity, and every entity was also teotl. Unlike Western philosophy, which fosters dichotomies such as the personal versus the impersonal, that of the Nahuas posited a sacred power that was united with everything; it was both intrinsic and *transcendent*.

5. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ In writing this passage, the author most likely intended to
	1. explain the system of principles that guided the **customs** of an ancient group of people
	1. [O] elaborate on a theoretical belief that is incongruous with other beliefs on a similar topic
	1. [O] describe the fundamental ideology of a certain society

6. According to the passage, the ancient philosophy of the Nahua people is different from European-based philosophy in that
	1. at the center of Nahua philosophy was a **detached and unmoving deity**, whereas Christianity is based on the notion of a dynamic, ever-flowing supernatural force
	1. Nahua philosophy consisted of **several interlocking concepts**, whereas Western philosophy is composed only of dichotomies
	1. Nahua philosophy was based on the notion that a vivifying and mutable force saturated all matter, whereas in **Western religion there is little or no division** between supernatural powers and the natural world
	1. rather than promoting mutually exclusive but dependent binaries, Nahua philosophy fostered an integrated and *holistic* worldview
	1. within Nahuas society there was not a strong **sense of individualism**, whereas in Western societies, worldviews based on dichotomies engender excessive concern for self

7. The definition of teotl and its comparison to the Judaeo-Christian deity plays which of the following roles within the passage?
	1. [?] It compares a lesser-known idea to a more common one to further understanding.
	1. It contrasts the sacred power of teotl with a more familiar object of veneration in order to illustrate that cultures often possess diverging **narratives** on the origins of the world and the organisms *therein*.
	1. It provides an explanation of the origins of the cosmos according to some of the proponents of Western philosophy.
	1. It bolsters the case for accepting an aboriginal explanation for the creation of the universe over a Western one.
	1. It encourages further inquiry into a lesser known understanding of the world.

In her self-portraits. Frida Kahlo blends realism and fantasy to capture the psychological and physical pain she constantly endured as a result of the *trolley* car accident she experienced as a young woman. This self-representation sets her apart from her contemporaries, who were more interested in public forms of art, such as murals. This was the time of the Mexican revolution, after all, a period that fostered an interest in nationalistic themes.

The more well-known artists of this period included David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco, and Juan O'Gorman. These figures dominated the Mexican art world in the 1920s and 1930s. Unlike her contemporaries. Kahlo's work did not achieve recognition until long after her death. In the late twentieth century, she became a feminist icon, a phenomenon attributable to the candor with which she portrayed issues relating to women.

8. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about Kahlo's contemporaries:
	1. They never painted self-portraits.
	1. [O] They received recognition for their work while they were still alive,
	1. [O] They used their art as a form of political expression.

9. The purpose of the author's discussion of the Mexican revolution is to
	1. provide a historical context for the reader to clarify what distinguished Kahlo's art from her contemporaries' art
	1. discuss aspects of Mexican history, such as the revolution and nationalism, which were irrelevant to Kahlo's art
	1. contrast the way male and female artists responded to a tumultuous time in Mexican history
	1. explain why it was not until after Kahlo's death that her work received greater acknowledgment
	1. highlight the differences between feminists and revolutionaries at the time that Kahlo was painting

The harshness and extreme unpopularity of the "war communism" system imposed in Russia from 1918 to 1921 led the Soviet leadership to adopt the New Economic Policy (NEP) in March of 1921. Under the NER the proanalog system of tax in kind was begun, and a semi-market economy was allowed to develop alongside government control of what Lenin had called the "commanding heights industries." When the NEP was abandoned in 1927, the state declared it a failure as a result of several adverse events: the scissors crisis, the goods famine, and speculation by "NEPmen."

The scissors crisis of 1923 was caused by high industrial prices relative to agricultural prices. When these two sets of prices are graphed, the wide disparity resembles an open pair of scissors. The government had been spurring industry but felt that this price disparity had to be immediately addressed. To do so, it adopted policies favoring agriculture. **There is some speculation by economists, however, that the scissors would have closed on their own.**

The goods famine occurred at roughly the same time. Because of burgeoning industry, demand for industrial and consumer products *skyrocketed*. The state could not produce goods equal to demand, forcing prices up. In the midst of shortages, the state found itself in a losing contest with "NEPmen," small entrepreneurs who sold goods at prices often higher than those of the state. NEPmen were seen as capitalists who sought to return the Soviet state to its position as *lapdog* to the Western capitalist states. Since the state could not produce or profit as well as the NEPmen, it adopted measures to put the NEPmen out of business. By 1926, speculating on pricing was a crime. As a result, profits and incentives had fallen, and the speculation crisis was somewhat alleviated.

10. Which of the following would make the most appropriate title for this passage?
	1. The Fall of the New Economic Policy
	1. An End to War Communism
	1. [O] Why the New Economic Policy Failed
	1. Three Crises that Ended an Era
	1. Soviet Economic Systems: an Overview

11. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ It can be inferred from the passage that each of the following accurately represent the author's opinions __EXCEPT__
	1. [O] NEPmen were like capitalists, who sought to earn their fortune **at the expense of others** and brought about the downfall of the NEP.
	1. The government was partially responsible for the goods famine, due to its inability to control supply and demand.
	1. [O] The war communism system caused the scissors crisis by spurring agriculture prices.

12. Select the sentence from the third paragraph which **describes an action** undertaken by the Soviet government.
	- By 1926, speculating on pricing was a crime.

13. The speculation by economists refers to which of the following beliefs?
	1. The government's belief that the crisis would one day have ended, even if the government had not moved to support agriculture
	1. Economists' belief that the government was mistaken in supporting agriculture over industry
	1. Economists' belief that the scissors crisis could have been averted without government intervention
	1. Economists' belief that the price disparity would have eventually resolved itself without action by the government
	1. The government's belief that agricultural and industrial prices would have balanced each other, but not in time to stop a crisis from occurring

The paintings of Eugene Delacroix are as political, complex, *tumultuous*, and vivid as the life of Lord Byron, who inspired some of Delacroix's best works, such as Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi and Scenes des massacres de Scio. Simultaneously, the paintings boast an incredible *melange* of the artistic traditions of prior masters and movements-such as a preoccupation with terribilitas from Michelangelo; a flair for color from Titian; and power, strength, and exuberance from Rubens-all underlain by the harmony and balance of classical artists and tinted with the Baroque. **Delacroix combined eclectic elements and infused them with his own genius,** creating a unique expression of Romanticism, and in so doing, inspired yet another style, Symbolism.

14. According to the passage, Delacroix`s painting Scenes des massacres de Scio was influenced by
	1. Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi
	1. a mix of artistic traditions
	1. the life of Lord Byron
	1. prior masters and their movements
	1. the Baroque period

15. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The passage suggests that which of the following are NOT unique elements of the paintings of Delacroix?
	1. [O] A tint of the Baroque
	1. [O] A preoccupation with terribilitas
	1. Diverse artistic traditions mixed with Delacroix`s own acumen

Sociobiologists, the most well known of whom is Edward O. Wilson, contend that **there is a biological basis for the social behavior of animals**, and they test their hypotheses through observation of animals in situations. Species studied have varied as widely as to encompass both termites and *rhesus macaques*. Sociobiologists further argue that students of human behavior cannot adequately account for the *panoply* of human nature through only such traditional variables as culture, ethnicity, and environment but must also include evolutionary processes. However, many scientists, notably Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, have criticized this approach to the study of humans on a number of grounds: for example, that it is based on Eurocentric notions and that it is plagued by methodological problems. **These detractors label it a pseudo-science** because sociobiological theories are not *falsifiable* and thus, in this respect, are similar to alchemy or astrology.

16. The author mentions culture, ethnicity, and environment in order to
	1. offer justification for a comparative study between termite colonies and rhesus macques
	1. assert that sociobiology is problematic because it is Eurocentric and beset by methodological complications
	1. illustrate that sociobiology is an inappropriate method for studying humans
	1. enumerate some variables that socio-biologists believe are insufficient in the study of humans and thus necessitate the addition of biological considerations
	1. provide a comprehensive list of the factors that influence human behavior

17. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. offer **praise** for an influential scientific approach to the study of animal and human behavior
	1. **argue** for a sociobiological approach to the study of human behavior
	1. **dispute** a sociobiological approach to the study of human behavior
	1. justify a sociobiological approach to the study of **termite colonies and rhesus macaques**
	1. [O] *set forth* an influential approach to the study of animal and human behavior and discuss some objections to this approach

18. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ It can be inferred that Gould and Lewontin might agree with which of the following statements about a sociobiological approach to the study of humans?
	1. [O] Sociobiological theories cannot be proven false, and consequently they cannot be conclusively verified; thus, sociobiology is not a real science.
	1. [O] When applied to the study of humans, sociobiology is problematic because it is rooted in a Western worldview and it does not comport with proper scientific methodology.
	1. Scientists cannot adequately explain human behavior through the consideration of cultural, ethnic, and environmental factors alone; therefore, they must resort to sociobiological explanations.

**William Le Baron Jenney** is considered the founder of the Chicago School of architecture, as well as the father of the American skyscraper. He served as an engineering officer during the Civil War but by 1868 was a practicing architect. His greatest accomplishments were his mammoth commercial buildings, including the Home Insurance Building in Chicago, which was one of the first buildings to use a metal skeleton.

This structure, in fact, would become the archetypical American skyscraper design. Other notable accomplishments included his 16-story Manhattan Building, which was the first edifice ever to achieve that height, and the Horticultural Building, which was the largest botanical conservatory ever erected.

**William Holabird** also assisted in the evolution of the Chicago School, beginning as a draftsman for Jenney and then founding his own practice in 1880. Holabird invented the "Chicago window," which made buildings appear to be constructed of glass.

19. The author mentions the "Chicago window" in order to
	1. highlight a feature of glass buildings
	1. strengthen the argument that Holabird developed the Chicago School
	1. argue that Holabird was a better inventor than Jenney
	1. provide an example of Holabird`s contributions to the Chicago School
	1. demonstrate the artistry of architecture

20. __Consider each of the following answer choices separately and select all that apply.__ According to the passage, which of the following describe William Jenney
	1. He served as an architect during the Civil War.
	1. [O] He is credited with the development of a much-copied design for skyscrapers.
	1. [?] He designed buildings in New York, as well as Chicago.
