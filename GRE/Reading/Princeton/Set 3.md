## Questions

It has frequently been argued that freeing schools from the rigid rules, regulations, and statutes that have traditionally fettered them would have a revolutionary effect on academic achievement. For instance, it has been suggested that schools embodying this idea could develop more effective teaching methods that could then be replicated in other schools. *Charter schools*-public schools that operate under a contract, or "charter"-were given just such an opportunity beginning in 1991, when Minnesota passed the first charter school law. At that time, many critics warned of deleterious rather than beneficial effects that such *freewheeling* schools could have on the academic achievement of students. Thus, while public opinion differed concerning the social desirability of charter schools, most agreed that there would be a pronounced effect.

Surprisingly, educators who study educational reform now seriously question the degree to which charter schools have made an impact. **They conclude that freedom** from many of the policies and regulations affecting traditional public schools and the *concomitant* control over decisions that guide the day-to-day affairs of the school **have not resulted in equally dramatic changes in students' academic performance.** In some states, charter schools are less likely to meet state performance standards than traditional public schools. It is, however, impossible to know whether this difference is due to the performance of the schools, the prior achievement of the students, or some other factor.

Metrics for educational *accountability* have changed considerably in the past decade, moving increasingly to performance as measured by state mandated tests of individual student achievement. Fundamentally, however, the challenging conditions under which schools operate, be they traditional or charter, have changed little: the struggle for resources, low pay for teachers, accountability to multiple stakeholders, and the difficulty of meeting the educational requirements of children with special needs all persist.

According to scholars, the indigenous peoples of ancient Mesoamerica, specifically the Nahuas, developed a rich and complex philosophy comprising four interrelated and overlapping branches of knowledge: metaphysics, epistemology, theory of value, and aesthetics. At **the core of their philosophy was teotl**, which, rather than an immutable supernatural being like the Judaeo-Christian deity, was an ever-moving and ever-changing, self-producing sacred power that animated the universe and its contents. **It was responsible for all things in nature - animals, rocks, rain, and so on - and permeated the details of everything.** There was no distinction between teotl and the natural world; teotl was in every entity, and every entity was also teotl. Unlike Western philosophy, which fosters dichotomies such as the personal versus the impersonal, that of the Nahuas posited a sacred power that was united with everything; it was both intrinsic and *transcendent*.

5. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ In writing this passage, the author most likely intended to

	1. [O] describe the fundamental ideology of a certain society

6. According to the passage, the ancient philosophy of the Nahua people is different from European-based philosophy in that
	1. at the center of Nahua philosophy was a **detached and unmoving deity**, whereas Christianity is based on the notion of a dynamic, ever-flowing supernatural force
	1. Nahua philosophy consisted of **several interlocking concepts**, whereas Western philosophy is composed only of dichotomies
	1. Nahua philosophy was based on the notion that a vivifying and mutable force saturated all matter, whereas in **Western religion there is little or no division** between supernatural powers and the natural world
	1. rather than promoting mutually exclusive but dependent binaries, Nahua philosophy fostered an integrated and *holistic* worldview
	1. within Nahuas society there was not a strong **sense of individualism**, whereas in Western societies, worldviews based on dichotomies engender excessive concern for self

	1. [?] It compares a lesser-known idea to a more common one to further understanding.
	1. It contrasts the sacred power of teotl with a more familiar object of veneration in order to illustrate that cultures often possess diverging **narratives** on the origins of the world and the organisms *therein*.

	1. It bolsters the case for accepting an aboriginal explanation for the creation of the universe over a Western one.
	1. It encourages further inquiry into a lesser known understanding of the world.

In her self-portraits. Frida Kahlo blends realism and fantasy to capture the psychological and physical pain she constantly endured as a result of the *trolley* car accident she experienced as a young woman. This self-representation sets her apart from her contemporaries, who were more interested in public forms of art, such as murals. This was the time of the Mexican revolution, after all, a period that fostered an interest in nationalistic themes.

The more well-known artists of this period included David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco, and Juan O'Gorman. These figures dominated the Mexican art world in the 1920s and 1930s. Unlike her contemporaries. Kahlo's work did not achieve recognition until long after her death. In the late twentieth century, she became a feminist icon, a phenomenon attributable to the candor with which she portrayed issues relating to women.

8. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about Kahlo's contemporaries:
	1. They never painted self-portraits.
	1. [O] They received recognition for their work while they were still alive,
	1. [O] They used their art as a form of political expression.

9. The purpose of the author's discussion of the Mexican revolution is to
	1. provide a historical context for the reader to clarify what distinguished Kahlo's art from her contemporaries' art
	1. discuss aspects of Mexican history, such as the revolution and nationalism, which were irrelevant to Kahlo's art
	1. contrast the way male and female artists responded to a tumultuous time in Mexican history
	1. explain why it was not until after Kahlo's death that her work received greater acknowledgment
	1. highlight the differences between feminists and revolutionaries at the time that Kahlo was painting

The harshness and extreme unpopularity of the "war communism" system imposed in Russia from 1918 to 1921 led the Soviet leadership to adopt the New Economic Policy (NEP) in March of 1921. Under the NER the proanalog system of tax in kind was begun, and a semi-market economy was allowed to develop alongside government control of what Lenin had called the "commanding heights industries." When the NEP was abandoned in 1927, the state declared it a failure as a result of several adverse events: the scissors crisis, the goods famine, and speculation by "NEPmen."

The scissors crisis of 1923 was caused by high industrial prices relative to agricultural prices. When these two sets of prices are graphed, the wide disparity resembles an open pair of scissors. The government had been spurring industry but felt that this price disparity had to be immediately addressed. To do so, it adopted policies favoring agriculture. **There is some speculation by economists, however, that the scissors would have closed on their own.**

The goods famine occurred at roughly the same time. Because of burgeoning industry, demand for industrial and consumer products *skyrocketed*. The state could not produce goods equal to demand, forcing prices up. In the midst of shortages, the state found itself in a losing contest with "NEPmen," small entrepreneurs who sold goods at prices often higher than those of the state. NEPmen were seen as capitalists who sought to return the Soviet state to its position as *lapdog* to the Western capitalist states. Since the state could not produce or profit as well as the NEPmen, it adopted measures to put the NEPmen out of business. By 1926, speculating on pricing was a crime. As a result, profits and incentives had fallen, and the speculation crisis was somewhat alleviated.

10. Which of the following would make the most appropriate title for this passage?
	1. The Fall of the New Economic Policy
	1. An End to War Communism
	1. [O] Why the New Economic Policy Failed
	1. Three Crises that Ended an Era
	1. Soviet Economic Systems: an Overview

11. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ It can be inferred from the passage that each of the following accurately represent the author's opinions __EXCEPT__
	1. [O] NEPmen were like capitalists, who sought to earn their fortune **at the expense of others** and brought about the downfall of the NEP.
	1. The government was partially responsible for the goods famine, due to its inability to control supply and demand.
	1. [O] The war communism system caused the scissors crisis by spurring agriculture prices.

12. Select the sentence from the third paragraph which **describes an action** undertaken by the Soviet government.
	- By 1926, speculating on pricing was a crime.

13. The speculation by economists refers to which of the following beliefs?
	1. The government's belief that the crisis would one day have ended, even if the government had not moved to support agriculture
	1. Economists' belief that the government was mistaken in supporting agriculture over industry
	1. Economists' belief that the scissors crisis could have been averted without government intervention
	1. Economists' belief that the price disparity would have eventually resolved itself without action by the government
	1. The government's belief that agricultural and industrial prices would have balanced each other, but not in time to stop a crisis from occurring
