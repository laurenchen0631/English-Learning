The term "revolution" has been reserved by most historians for social upheaval characterized by bloodshed, the use of force, and great technological change. Historian Robert Cornwall __cogently__ argues that the term can be extended to apply to the massive agricultural transformation that took place in the mid- to late-eighteenth century.

Farming practices in the 1700s were largely unchanged from those in the preceding centuries: Hordes of peasants labored on the land for long hours with only meager crop yields to show for their hard work. The eighteenth century brought improved transportation, progress in animal breeding, new crops, and better farming techniques, all of which served to increase the overall crop yield. However, **the greatest impact on English agricultural yields may well have come from the significant expansion of enclosure.** Prior to the mid-eighteenth century, farming was a communal activity in which the entire village decided what, where, and when to plant. **To combat soil exhaustion, farmers were required to leave a field fallow every third year, a practice which led to massive inefficiencies.** The practice of enclosure allowed farmers to maintain a better balance between arable land and pasture. Land that was worn out could be converted to grazing land for cattle, thus enriching and restoring it.

To move beyond subsistence-level farming, **new ways to transport excess crops to market had to be found.** The development of canal systems as well as an expanded and improved roadway system facilitated transportation.

Chinua Achebe's masterpiece Things Fall Apart was borne out of Achebe's frustration at the manner in which African nations had, up until then, been portrayed in European novels. The book tells of Christian missionaries to Nigeria who disrupt traditional *Igbo* life, thereby driving the *protagonist* Oknokwo, a village elder, to suicide.

Achebe's book gained him instant recognition. **Critics rightly praised the book's vivid accounts** of tribal beliefs and culture, and commended Achebe's inclusion of Igbo proverbs. He was recognized not only as a historian, but also as a novelist whose work could be likened to that of a Greek tragedy.

**However**, not all critical views of Achebe's work were __laudatory__. **Some critics felt that Achebe's novel placed undue blame on the colonialists.** These critics argued that Achebe's portrayal did not show adequate gratitude for the introduction of Western culture and technology.
