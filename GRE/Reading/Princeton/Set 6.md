The term "revolution" has been reserved by most historians for social upheaval characterized by bloodshed, the use of force, and great technological change. Historian Robert Cornwall __cogently__ argues that the term can be extended to apply to the massive agricultural transformation that took place in the mid- to late-eighteenth century.

Farming practices in the 1700s were largely unchanged from those in the preceding centuries: Hordes of peasants labored on the land for long hours with only meager crop yields to show for their hard work. The eighteenth century brought improved transportation, progress in animal breeding, new crops, and better farming techniques, all of which served to increase the overall crop yield. However, **the greatest impact on English agricultural yields may well have come from the significant expansion of enclosure.** Prior to the mid-eighteenth century, farming was a communal activity in which the entire village decided what, where, and when to plant. **To combat soil exhaustion, farmers were required to leave a field fallow every third year, a practice which led to massive inefficiencies.** The practice of enclosure allowed farmers to maintain a better balance between arable land and pasture. Land that was worn out could be converted to grazing land for cattle, thus enriching and restoring it.

To move beyond subsistence-level farming, **new ways to transport excess crops to market had to be found.** The development of canal systems as well as an expanded and improved roadway system facilitated transportation.

1. The passage suggests that which of the following needed to take place in order for the agricultural revolution to take hold?
	1. large-scale social upheaval and bloodshed
	2. an increase in the number of peasants free to work the fields
	3. the infrastructure by which excess crops could be transported
	4. a widespread understanding of the necessity of crop rotation
	5. the lifting of legal restrictions preventing enclosure

2. The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which of the following?
	1. In the past, historians have not generally considered large-scale changes in agriculture to be revolutionary.
	1. Agricultural expansion in England would have occurred at a faster pace had it not been for the **restriction of enclosure** placed on farmers.
	1. Communal farming had a **disastrous effect** on English agriculture.
	1. Eighteenth century farming was hampered by **insufficient numbers of peasants** available to work the land.

3. Click on the sentence in the second paragraph that best illustrates the problems incurred by communal farmers.
	- To combat soil exhaustion, farmers were required to leave a field fallow every third year, a practice which led to massive inefficiencies.

4. The word __cogently__ as it is used in this passage is closest in meaning to
	1. persuasively
	1. enigmatically
	1. inadvertently
	1. inconclusively
	1. questioningly

Chinua Achebe's masterpiece Things Fall Apart was borne out of Achebe's frustration at the manner in which African nations had, up until then, been portrayed in European novels. The book tells of Christian missionaries to Nigeria who disrupt traditional *Igbo* life, thereby driving the *protagonist* Oknokwo, a village elder, to suicide.

Achebe's book gained him instant recognition. **Critics rightly praised the book's vivid accounts** of tribal beliefs and culture, and commended Achebe's inclusion of Igbo proverbs. He was recognized not only as a historian, but also as a novelist whose work could be likened to that of a Greek tragedy.

**However**, not all critical views of Achebe's work were __laudatory__. **Some critics felt that Achebe's novel placed undue blame on the colonialists.** These critics argued that Achebe's portrayal did not show adequate gratitude for the introduction of Western culture and technology.

5. The word laudatory, as used in the passage, could most effectively be replaced with which of the following?
	1. approbative
	1. analytical
	1. *dispassionate*
	1. *paradigmatic*
	1. unequivocal

6. Click on the sentence in the passage that best illustrates the author's opinion of Achebe's Things Fall Apart.
	- Critics **rightly** praised the book's vivid accounts** of tribal beliefs and culture, and commended Achebe's inclusion of Igbo proverbs.

7. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. explain the source of Achebe's desire to write his novel
	1. present an overview of the critical context in which Achebe's work has been viewed
	1. prove that Achebe's work is worthy of critical acclaim
	1. analyze the historical background in which Achebe writes
	1. explain how Achebe's novel fits within the context of Igbo literature

In analyzing the poetry of Mona Feather, we are confronted with **three different *yardsticks* by which to measure her work**. We could consider her poems as the product of a **twentieth-century artist** in the tradition of James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, and Wallace Stevens. However, to do so would be to ignore a facet of her that informs every word she writes and that stems from her identity as a **woman**. Yet, to characterize her solely as a woman poet is to deny her cultural heritage, for Mona Feather is also the **first modern poet of stature who is also an American Indian.**

Stanley Wilson has argued compellingly that the huge popularity Feather enjoys among the Indian reservation school population of the United States is creating a whole new generation of poetry enthusiasts in an age when the reading of poetry is on the wane. **While this is undoubtedly true, Mr. Wilson's praise gives the impression that Feather's readership is limited to her own culture**-an impression which hints that Mr. Wilson is himself only measuring her by one criterion. Radical feminist writers have long found in Feather's poetry a sense of self-pride which struck a chord with their own more political philosophies. Her imagery, which always made use of the early Native American traditions in which the woman had an important role, was seen as the awakened sensibility of a *kindred* spirit.

Yet for all the "feminist" touches in her writing, it would be a *disservice* to *consign* Feather to the ranks of politicized writers, for her message is deeper than that. **The despair that characterized twentieth-century modern poets is to be found in Mona Feather's work as well**; she writes of the American Indians of the 1930s confined to ever-shrinking reservations and finds in that a metaphor for all of modern mankind trapped on a shrinking earth of limited resources.

8. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. describe the work of Mona Feather
	1. compare Feather with Joyce, Eliot, and Stevens
	1. show Feather's roots in her Native American heritage
	1. argue that Mona Feather's work can be looked at in several different ways
	1. discuss the women's movement in America

9. The passage implies that the author believes Stanley Wilson's view of Feather is
	1. a compelling and **complete assessment** of her work
	1. focused too much on her status as a Native American poet
	1. meant to disguise his opinion of Feather as a poet **lacking in talent**
	1. critical of Native American **children's literary** judgment
	1. **based on all** major themes and images in her poetry

10. The author mentions James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, and Wallace Stevens in order to
	1. compare the **political messages** in Feather's work to those in the work of other authors
	1. **highlight the radical differences** between male and female poets in the twentieth century
	1. contrast Feather's **thematic choices** with those of her contemporaries
	1. enumerate a list of artists whose sensibilities made them Feather's **kindred spirits**
	1. [O] describe a critical context in which Feather's work can be analyzed

Scholars of early Buddhist art agree that **Buddha images in human form emerged** around the first century A.D. in the regions of Mathura, located in central India, and Gandhara, now part of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Uncertainty exists, however, about **whether Mathura or Gandhara has the stronger claim to *primacy***. Those who believe that *anthropomorphic* sculptures of the Buddha first appeared in Gandhara point out that earlier Buddhist art was largely *aniconic* and that *bas relief* was far more common than sculpture. They argue that **Greek influence in Gandhara promoted the development of the new style** and form of representation of the divine. Other scholars make the case for indigenous development of such representations in Mathura, citing a centuries-long record of iconic art in pre-Buddhist traditions. **They don't reject all foreign influence, but they argue that local traditions provided a strong foundation** for the development of Buddhist sculpture.

11. Which of the following, **if true,** would those who believe that **anthropomorphic images** of Buddha originated in Gandhara be likely to cite as evidence for **their viewpoint**?
	1. Pre-Buddhist subcultures in the Gandhara region created representations of their deities in human form.
	1. Mathuran Buddhas' lightweight robes appear to have been modeled on the real robes of people who lived in a warm climate.
	1. Gandharan artists were isolated from the larger society and not exposed to influences from outside the region.
	1. Rulers from the Mathura region had political ties to Greek rulers and frequently exchanged gifts with them.
	1. [O] The hairstyles worn by Gandharan Buddhas are similar to those depicted on Greek pottery from the same period.

12. According to the passage, Buddhist art
	1. first appeared in regions that are now part of India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan
	1. [O] experienced a period during which human representations of the Buddha were not common
	1. characteristically portrayed figures with **elongated earlobes** and strong facial features
	1. began to appear in the medium of **bas relief as a result of Greek influence**
	1. was more **influenced by foreign artworks than by indigenous** artistic traditions

According to most scientists, the universe began approximately 10 to 15 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. This theory, known as the Big Bang theory, is the fairly direct result of Hubble's law, which states that **objects farther away from Earth are receding faster than those closer.** This expansion implies a singular point which all matter is expanding from.

Complicating the scientific explanation is that the Big Bang **cannot be thought of as an explosion from some identifiable source**-rather, space and time were created in the Big Bang. Furthermore, the **relationship between distance and speed is not precisely linear**. So, if one were to think of galaxies as particles created in a big bang, these galaxies have both a local component of motion, as well as playing a role in the overall expansion of the universe.

A further complication is that galactic **distances are so great that galactic motion**, even if the galaxies are moving at incredible speeds, **is difficult to observe**. Scientists must therefore rely on a **"standard candle," an object of known brightness** within the galaxy they wish to observe. Using the inverse square law, scientists can then measure the how far that galaxy is away from our own. For instance, suppose **a supernova in galaxy A appears one hundred times as bright as one in galaxy B. By the inverse square law, galaxy B is ten times farther away than galaxy A**, **assuming, of course, that distance is the only factor affecting brightness.**

13. It can be inferred from the sentence highlighted in the passage that a standard candle is useful to scientists for which of the following reasons?
	1. Standard candles do not have their own *locus* of motion.
	1. Standard candles **more reliably adhere to the law** of inverse squares **than do other supernovas.**
	1. Only standard **candles provide a known measure of brightness.**
	1. Knowledge of an object's brightness of an object allows scientists to measure the speed at which the object is **moving toward Earth.**
	1. Knowledge of an object's brightness allows scientists to accurately measure its distance from Earth.

14. According to the passage, if two astronomical objects of differing distances from Earth were observed, which of the following would be true of the object closer to Earth? __Select all such statements__.
	1. [?] It would not be as bright as the object farther from Earth.
	1. It would be younger than the object farther from Earth.
	1. [O] It would be traveling away from the Earth more slowly than the farther object.

15. According to the passage, a standard candle may not provide an accurate measure of distance if
	1. the galaxy being measured is moving too quickly
	1. interstellar dust makes the object measured appear dimmer than it really is
	1. if the galaxy being measured has a local component of measurement
	1. the particles being measured do not completely accord with a linear motion
	1. the galaxies being measured move at different speeds

16. According to the passage, if two supernovas are observed and one of those supernovas is brighter than the other, scientists can conclude that
	1. the brighter supernova is moving **closer to our galaxy** at a higher speed
	1. the **precise location** of the supernova is measurable
	1. the brighter supernova **may be** closer to our own galaxy
	1. the brighter supernova is farther away from Earth by a distance that is roughly inversely proportional to the dim supernova
	1. the distance between the supernovas and our own galaxy is inversely proportional

Throughout the twentieth century, **it was accepted as fact** that cells in our brains, called neurons, do not regenerate. Research by neurologist **Elizabeth Gould overturned this core doctrine** within the span of a few years. Her experiments on rats showed that even after suffering severe trauma, their brains were able to heal themselves by regenerating neurons. **Gould's findings have incited a flood of new research** into applications that may take advantage of neurogenesis.

One such study examines the role of reduced neurogenesis among individuals suffering from depression. It is speculated that neurogenesis may contribute to an explanation for the so called "*Prozac* lag." As an antidepressant, the immediate boost of *serotonin* caused by Prozac should have had instantaneous mood elevating effects. However, patients suffering from depression **only begin to experience mood elevation weeks after beginning treatment**. The study speculates that during this period, the brain may be regenerating neurons.

17. The author mentions the "Prozac lag" primarily in order to
	1. raise a possible **objection** to a newly proposed theory
	1. present a situation for which a new theory may serve an explanatory role
	1. offer evidence that runs **counter** to a previously held belief
	1. suggest a **counterexample that undermines** a newly proposed theory
	1. provide supporting evidence that a newly discovered phenomenon may have **unforeseen effects**

18. In the second paragraph, select the sentence in which the author describes an **unexpected** observation.
	- **However**, patients suffering from depression only begin to experience mood elevation weeks after beginning treatment

While art historians do not necessarily agree on the date of the birth of modern art, they do agree that **mid-nineteenth century French art** shows a clear and distinct break from tradition. Pressed to point to a single picture that represents the vanguard of the modern art movement, art historians will often point to **Courbet's The Painter's Studio**.

The peculiar subtitle of Courbet's work, "Real allegory summing up a seven-year period of my life" confirms that Courbet was striving to do something strikingly original with his work. **The argument has been made that the painting struck a blow for the independence of the artist**, and that since Courbet's work, artists have felt freed from the societal demands placed upon their work. Paintings prior to Courbet's time were most often focused on depicting **events from the Bible, history, or literature**. With his singular painting, Courbet __promulgated__ the idea that an artist is capable of representing only that which he can experience through his senses of sight and touch; **the true artist will then be compelled to make his representation as simply and directly as possible.**

19. Which of the following would most effectively replace the word __promulgated__ as it is used in the context of the passage?
	1. displayed
	1. disseminated
	1. proclaimed
	1. concealed
	1. secreted

20. Click on the sentence in the passage that best explains the **effect of Courbet`s work** on other artists.
	- The argument has been made that the painting struck a blow for the independence of the artist, and that since Courbet's work, artists have felt freed from the societal demands placed upon their work

21. The effect that Courbet had on painting is most analogous to which situation?
	1. an *avant-garde* writer who subverts novelistic conventions
	1. a machinist who *tinkers* and improves his invention
	1. a watercolor painter who paints in the same style as his peers
	1. a scientist who comes up with a unified theory of several discordant scientific ideas
	1. a seamstress who makes a ball gown using several different types of fabric
