## Questions

**Little is known** about the elusive section of the earth's atmosphere known as the *mesosphere*. Located between the stratosphere (the maximum altitude that airplanes can achieve) and the *thermosphere* (the minimum altitude of spacecraft), the mesosphere is **poorly understood and little explored**. The most significant feature of the mesosphere is the various tides and waves that propagate up from the *troposphere* and stratosphere. The dissipation of these waves is largely responsible for propelling the mesosphere around the globe. These wave patterns are further affected when gas particles in the mesosphere collide with meteoroids, producing spectacular explosions, which usually generate enough heat to consume the meteor before it can fall to earth. The *conflagration* leaves behind traces of iron and other metals and fuels the atmospheric tides radiating outward from the mesosphere.

1. The author primarily describes the mesosphere as
	1. turbulent
	1. opaque
	1. unfamiliar
	1. radiant
	1. anarchic

Television programming is big business, with sales of *interstitial* advertising reaching billions of dollars annually. Advertising rates are determined by the viewership of the program **in question**, which has traditionally been determined by ACNielsen, part of The Nielsen Company. Nielsen wields an *immoderate* amount of industry *clout* considering its **questionable methods of statistics gathering.**

The Nielsen Company **relies on selected household**s to catalog their television watching habits in "diaries." The ratings are then reported as a percentage that indicates the number of viewers watching a television program at a given time. The company has come under criticism for choosing residences that underreport daytime and late-night television viewing and for overrepresenting minorities in sample populations. Critics also point to the **nonviable** practice of measuring how many individuals are watching a given television set and of gauging how attentive the audience is to a program or its advertising.

2. It can be inferred from the passage that the author considers the Nielsen Company's techniques
	1. intentionally biased
	1. dubious
	1. worthless
	1. *unscrupulous*
	1. overly boastful

Although multi-organ transplants have become more common, scientists and surgeons continue to face the ineluctable obstacle of time. Current donor organ preservation times hover around five to six hours. **Because of the complicated tissue-matching process, oftentimes organs are unable to reach their beneficiaries**, wasting valuable, viable organs. However, scientists are hopeful that a certain substance, called the Hibernation Induction Trigger (HIT), will extend the life of a potential transplant organ.

HIT is an opiate-like substance found in the blood of hibernating animals. Previous experiments have shown that opioids act as an **autoperfusion block**, preventing blood from flowing through the *lymphatic* system to organs, a phenomenon known as *ischemia*. In a preliminary experiment, an infusion of plasma with the Delta opioid delayed hemorrhaging in certain laboratory animals. When this arresting of activity was applied to the transplantation of organs, physicians reported preservation times up to 15 hours, a more than two-fold increase over standard conservation.

Scientists have extrapolated from these findings, further identifying the opioid **DADLE as integral to triggering the hibernation process.** Infusing HIT-molecule-containing plasma from hibernating woodchucks into canine lungs increased preservation times more than three-fold from previous findings. This experiment suggests that, should a potential donor organ be infused with these trigger molecules before the organ is harvested, the organ would remain transplantable for up to 45 hours, greatly increasing the chance for doctors to find a suitable recipient.

Though these results are exciting, they do nothing to increase survival rates from an organ transplant operation, which currently hover at 60 percent over four years, because patients are still susceptible to infection and rejection. **Scientists are a long way from declaring HIT-molecules a safe and consistent method of organ preservation.** Still, other areas of science have taken an interest in this research. NASA, for example, is considering the implications of human hibernation for deep space travel.

3. Given the information in the passage about blocking autoperfusion, which of the following could also be true?
	1. DADLE and HIT **must be present in an organ at the same time** in order for autoperfusion to be prevented for any length of time.
	1. If scientists could circumvent the passage of blood through the lymphatic system, organs would **cease** to deteriorate.
	1. Scientists are close to developing a method to induce **production of HIT in a non-hibernating animal.**
	1. Administering HIT after transplantation is likely to **lower the current rates of infection** and organ rejection.
	1. [O] **Isolating and infusing opioids** may be the key to retarding the progression of decay in transplant organs.

4. The author refers to the experiment with the woodchuck in order to
	1. illustrate successful preliminary experiments
	1. suggest genetic similarity between species
	1. warn that the findings are preliminary at best
	1. explain why other scientists may be interested in the findings
	1. suggest the feasibility of inter-species transplant

5. Select the sentence from the passage which suggests how the use of isolated HIT molecules, if they were to be approved for general use, would be limited.
	- [O] This experiment suggests that, should a potential donor organ be infused with these trigger molecules before the organ is harvested, the organ would remain transplantable for up to 45 hours, greatly increasing the chance for doctors to find a suitable recipient.

6. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
	1. Ischemia is essential to the organ transplantation process.
	1. The same process by which HIT induces hibernation might be applicable to donor organs.
	1. The biggest obstacle facing physicians in the science of organ transplantation is the difficulty of matching suitable donors and recipients.
	1. Additional time could be saved by computerizing the tissue-matching process.
	1. HIT could also be administered to patients awaiting an organ transplant, thereby lengthening the amount of time they are eligible for surgery.

It **might seem illogical** that the development of modern currency rests on a scientific discovery, but the invention of the **"touchstone" allowed ancient societies to create a standard by which valuable metals could be judged**. In its most basic form, a touchstone is any dark, finely grained stone upon which soft metals leave traces. When rubbed, a process known as "probing," precious metal alloy cleaves to the stone, leaving a stripe. The color of the stripe (which reveals the percentage of its content that is base metal) can then be compared to a stripe of a known grade of standard alloy. Despite its primitiveness, this probing process allowed merchants to examine alloys quickly and with reasonable certainty. Though civilizations were using gold and silver currencies as early as 500 b.c., coins were easily forged or *diluted* with less valuable metals, such as tin or lead. **The invention and popularization of the touchstone ensured that pure gold and silver could become a standard expression of value.**

7. The author's description of how coins were adulterated is included in the passage in order to
	1. illustrate the historical precedent replaced by the invention
	1. outline for the reader the chronology of the events in the passage
	1. explain the larger importance of the details just provided
	1. give the passage a cultural context
	1. dismiss a misleading counterargument

8. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The passage indicates that **the advances brought about by the probing process** included
	1. [O] an efficient means of ascertaining the purity of a metal
	1. a means by which governments could standardize currency values
	1. [O] a measure of security against adulterated coins

9. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. demonstrate that science can influence non-scientific progress
	1. underline the touchstone's importance in the history of currency
	1. explain how the touchstone is able to measure the purity of an alloy
	1. explore the etymology of the word "touchstone"
	1. refute an historical misconception

Historically, sociologists have presumed that **people will attribute certain characteristics to a member of a particular group when it is generally believed that most members of that group possess the characteristics in question**. For sociologists Hepburn and Locksley, such social stereotyping has **led to the broader question** of whether people are cognizant of their own stereotyping behavior. Seemingly, if one knows that one holds a stereotypical notion such as "all members of a certain ethnic group are natural musicians," then one might also be aware that the notion that "a particular musician of that ethnic group is a great musician" is a *corollary* of that stereotype. **However, people are most aware of their stereotyping when they have no information.** When given information that conforms to their beliefs and the individual case observed, people become less aware of their tendency to stereotype and therefore more likely to engage in stereotyping.

10. The author of the passage is primarily concerned with
	1. [O] investigations into stereotyping and an awareness of stereotyping by individuals
	1. an examination of the relative truths behind well known stereotypes
	1. an attempt to prove that stereotypes are a result of ignorance
	1. a refutation of a broader question surrounding stereotypes
	1. a detailed list of when individuals are likely to be aware that they are applying stereotypes

11. Which of the following best describes the function of the first sentence?
	1. To present a **criticism of Hepburn and Locksley's conceptualization** of why individuals stereotype
	1. To provide **evidence to support Hepburn and Locksley's claims** about the problems inherent with stereotyping
	1. [O] To provide the backdrop for Hepburn and Locksley's study
	1. To provide an overview of a **social phenomenon** and its contributions to Hepburn and Locksley's area of inquiry
	1. To provide a **history** of social stereotyping alongside Hepburn and Locksley's reservations about the practice

Women played a substantial role in the furthering of the Polish art song in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. One notable woman from this time period was Maria Szymanowska, who was both a concert pianist and a composer.

Szymanowska was a member of the Warsaw Music Society who contributed pieces to a cycle entitled Historical Songs. Her songs are by far the most creative and individualistic of the cycle. In addition, Szymanowska composed more than one hundred other pieces, mostly for the piano, including six romances.

Her songs most resemble French romances, and she also employs *Polonaise* rhythms in two of her songs. In all her works, the *melodic line* is technically superior. She employs *idiomatic* keyboard writing, wide chord-spacing, broad *cantilenas*, and interesting *modulations*. She also uses the most compelling registers of the instrument and pianistic keys. Her romances are on par with those of Beethoven, Schubert, and Mozart. In fact, Szymanowska was praised by her contemporaries, such as Schumann, who lauded her *etudes*. Her piano playing was frequently equated to that of Hummel, though Szymanowska's was said to be more ethereal. Thus, she is a *progenitor* of *Chopin* in both piano technique and composition.

**Female contributors to the development of Polish music have been chiefly ignored.** From the meager records which have been preserved, it is incontrovertible that Polish women were, in fact, playing, instructing, and writing music as early as the fifteenth century. However, *patriarchal* societal structures have precluded adequate documentation about, and preservation of, their work. __Unless changes take place, human society will be made poorer for its inability to recognize the expertise and inventiveness of these women.__

12. According to the passage, the musical contributions of Polish women have been neglected due to
	1. an absence of **any documentation** of the efforts of female composers
	1. improper **preservation of musical scores** produced by women
	1. [O] the **male-dominated social order** that has existed since at least the fifteenth centuiy
	1. society **willfully ignoring** the talent and hard work of **female composers**
	1. the fact that people did **not realize** the genius and creativity of female composers

13. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ Which of the following can be properly inferred from the passage?
	1. Szymanowska's advancement of the music of Polish art songs in spite of patriarchal pressure demonstrates her **feminist tendencies.**
	1. [O] Szymanowska composed works beyond the genre of the Polonaise that are deserving of praise.
	1. Szymanowska's works that contributed to the development of Polish art song garnered a disproportionate amount of attention, considering that such **compositions were only a small part of her repertoire.**

14. Select the sentence in the third paragraph that gives evidence for the idea that **Szymanowska's work laid the foundation** for at least one future composer.
	- Thus, she is a progenitor of Chopin in both piano technique and composition

15. The author's tone in the final sentence ("Unless changes ... these women") is best described as
	1. nostalgic
	1. [O] *emphatic*
	1. dismissive
	1. perplexed
	1. [?] didactic

In The Federalist Number Ten. James Madison forewarned against the **dangers of factions-groups of people with a common interest adverse to the overall good of the nation**, what today are referred to as "special interest groups." Madison described two hypothetical ways to check a faction: Either eliminate the causes or mitigate the effects of the faction. To eliminate the causes, the government would either have to make all people perfectly equal, an impossible goal, or take away people's liberty and thus defeat the purpose of having a republican form of government. Madison argued, alternatively, for **ameliorating the effects of factions by enlarging the population of the country and thus diluting their influence.** If there are a sufficient number of diverse peoples, it will be difficult for a majority to share a common interest at the same time.

16. Which of the following can be most correctly inferred from the passage?
	1. Madison solved the problem of factions in the United States.
	1. Madison thought that the best solution was to make all citizens equal.
	1. Madison argued against a republican government in The Federalist Number Ten.
	1. [?] Madison analyzed the effects of increased population.
	1. [O] Madison considered more than one way to constrain factions.

17. According to the passage, why does Madison believe it necessary to check a faction?
	1. Madison considered factions to be detrimental to the common welfare.
	1. Madison thought factions were a way to encourage population growth.
	1. Madison relied on factions to support the republican style of government.
	1. Madison accepted factions as a consequence of allowing people to participate in government.
	1. Madison surmised that factions would likely be run by his political adversaries.

The *anti-foundationalist* belief that there is no secure basis for knowledge was **worked out philosophically in the somewhat wearisome tracts of Jacques Derrida.** Difference, Derrida tells us, is the idea that **any attempts to discuss universal features of human nature are merely products of local standards**, often serving the *vested* interests of the status quo, and should rightly be dismantled and critiqued. Derrida was considered the originator of a profound challenge to the history of human thought. **However, a century before Derrida. Darwin's theory of natural selection had made anti-foundationalism almost an inevitable consequence.** From an evolutionary point of view, our understanding of the world depends on earlier and less-developed forms of understanding; meaning is continuously referred or deferred to other terms or experiences.

18. Select the sentence which states a position with which the author does NOT agree.
	- Derrida was considered the originator of a profound challenge to the history of human thought

19. The passage implies that which of the following beliefs is embraced by anti-foundationalists?
	1. In many cases humans cannot be completely secure in thinking that they fully understand a given situation.
	1. The meaning of an experience can best **be understood outside the cultural** context in which it occurs.
	1. Those **who are part of the status quo** are best able to dismantle and critique society.
	1. Derrida's work would not have been possible without the prior *ruminations* of Darwin a century earlier.
	1. Darwin's faith in the status quo is sufficient grounds to develop universal truths about cultural experiences.

20. Derrida's definition of difference suggests that he would most likely subscribe to which of the following beliefs?
	1. The interests of the status quo always maintain local standards.
	1. Ideas expressed by those who are part of the status quo do not necessarily represent a universally accepted truth.
	1. Any attempts to discuss human nature serve the interests of the status quo.
	1. The interests of the status quo should be critiqued and dismantled by those who are part of the status quo.
	1. Ideas that are a product of local standards cannot contain elements of a universal truth.

## Review
5. 明确题目问的是“the use of isolated HIT molecules”， 而不是transplant process本身。大多数人选的第12句强调的是transplant process的局限性，而不是HIT-molecure的。should a potential donor organ be infused with these trigger molecules before the organ is harvested 一句表明了 isolated HIT molecules 的使用限制

11. The first sentence states that sociologists have historically held the view that individuals stereotype. The rest of the paragraph delves into Hepburn and Locksley’s study, which investigates the extent to which people are aware of their own stereotyping behavior. Therefore, the first sentence provides the historical background for Hepburn and Locksley’s study. The closest answer is therefore choice (C)
