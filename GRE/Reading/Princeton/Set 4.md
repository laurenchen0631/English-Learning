"Solar wind" is the term scientists use to describe the stream of particles that the sun's *corona* constantly emits. These solar winds, which consist mainly of hydrogen and helium, are intensely hot, fully ionized plasma. Because of the corona's intense heat, these particles continuously escape the sun's gravitational attraction, flowing away from the sun at extreme velocities. Solar winds, though, are not without variation, because **they contain faster and slower moving *pockets*.** For instance, solar winds that originate from *streamers* are slower moving winds at approximately 300 km/second, as opposed to the winds that originate from *corona holes* and reach speeds of 800 km/second. As they flow away from the sun. tangential discontinuities and interplanetary shocks form, producing pressure variations. Moreover, researchers also know that **solar winds are directly related to geomagnetic storms, auroras, and comets**. It is these winds that cause comet tails to bend away from the sun, as Kepler accurately predicted in the early 1600s.

Studies have been done on the effect of solar winds on the planets in the solar system. While all the planets are surrounded by this hot, super-charged plasma, the Earth's magnetic field protects it from the solar wind by deflecting the particles. However, solar winds are responsible for the Earth's magnetosphere, and **changes in their speed and direction strongly influence Earth's space environment.** As the planet closest to the sun. Mercury endures the main impact of solar winds. If Mercury had an atmosphere, these winds would have stripped it away, leaving the planet bathed in radiation. Though Mars is much further from the sun than Mercury, solar winds have also greatly reduced its atmosphere. While Venus has a substantial atmosphere-100 times denser than ours-solar winds reduce its clouds. It is not just those planets nearest the sun which bear the effects of solar winds: The winds travel far beyond the limits of *Pluto*. Interestingly. **while much is now known about solar winds**, scientists still do not fully understand how the gases and particles in the sun's corona reach such high velocities.

1. It can be inferred from the passage that the **Earth's magnetic field** acts to
	1. absorb the particles blown by solar winds
	1. incinerate the particles present in solar winds
	1. *assimilate* the particles in solar winds into the Earth's atmosphere
	1. divert the particles in solar winds from the Earth
	1. re-orient the particles in solar winds toward a central collection point

2. The author most likely discusses Kepler's predictions in order to
	1. [O] illustrate the observable effect solar winds have had on other celestial objects
	1. denounce Kepler's work as unreliable because the technology required to study solar winds directly has only been developed within the last century
	1. describe more generally the first major contribution to the study of solar winds and the sun
	1. disprove Kepler's theories on the motion of comets and auroras
	1. establish a standard against which to compare the observations concerning the atmospheres of Mars and Mercury

3. Select the sentence that attempts to correct a **possible misconception** about the effects of solar winds.
 - It is not just those planets nearest the sun which bear the effects of solar winds: The winds travel far beyond the limits of Pluto

4. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ According to the passage, which of the following is true of the effect of solar winds on the Earth?
	1. [O] Though the Earth's magnetic field largely protects it from the full effects of solar winds, the winds have an impact on its magnetosphere and its space environment.
	1. [O] Solar winds play a **significant** role in the development of auroras and geomagnetic storms in the earth's space environment.
	1. [?] Because of the corona's intense heat, solar wind particles continuously escape the sun's gravitational attraction, flowing away from the corona at extremely high velocities and **surrounding the Earth** with hot, super-charged plasma.

The American people have an incorrect understanding of what it means to be at war. At least, so argues T.H. Pickett in his conservative interpretation of American military history.

Pickett does present a wealth of examples, along with a refreshingly candid argument that America often goes to war for an abstract ideal such as democratization of societies, world peace, liberty, or freedom. For instance, the Spanish-American War of 1898 was *ostensibly* a consequence of national enthusiasm for the cause of Cuban liberty. And. more obviously, America's entry into World War I stemmed from a desire to "make the world safe for democracy." **Although these observations are supportable, Pickett overstates the case** when he argues that these abstract causes typically lead to a war hysteria in which American leadership can no longer enforce any measured policies.

5. Which of the following best states the author's main point?
	1. Pickett's study overturned the conventional understanding of why America engages in warfare.
	1. Pickett's study is valuable primarily because it provides a thorough understanding of the causes of American warfare.
	1. The rationale for American warfare is well documented.
	1. Pickett provides a cogent rationale for why America engages in warfare; however, he draws conclusions that the author does not fully support.
	1. Pickett's analysis of American military history provides the definitive historical record of the period from the Spanish-American War to World War I.

6. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ It can be inferred from the description of Pickett's work that the author believes which of the following?
	1. [O] The desire for tangible rewards is not always the primary reason that America enters into warfare.
	1. [O] Democratization of a foreign country was a rationale for at least one war that America has waged.
	1. [O] Pickett provides a large number of examples to bolster his case.

Some readers categorize Maxine Hong Kings-ton as a great Asian-American writer, a classification that is ultimately too narrow for her body of work. However, the subject matter of Kingston's novels and autobiographies espouses the Asian immigrant experience, as the following characters suggest: immigrant laborers in California and Hawaii, railroad laborers, and Chinese doctors. In natural harmony with her choice of subject matter are the personal *sensibilities* of a first-generation American writer who endeavors to explain her mother's alien sensibility and her relationship with her silent, angry father.

Kingston's Asian influences are present in another type of work. Chinese myths in the guise of "talk stories." A character in her novel Tripmaster Monkey is based on Sun Wu Kong, a mythical Chinese figure. In response to this work. Herbert Gold notes that the author "invigorates her novel with an *avid* personal perspective, doing what the novel is supposed to do-she brings us the news of the world and makes magic of it."

7. The author focuses on the content of Kingston's work primarily to
	1. [O] illustrate why one might be tempted to call Kingston an Asian-American author
	1. assert why Kingston's work is difficult to categorize
	1. explain why Kingston's work is thought by many to have universal appeal
	1. illustrate how Kingston's work is affected by her parental influences
	1. show what makes Kingston unique among Asian-American writers

8. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ It can be inferred that Kingston uses "talk stories"
	1. to provide an outlet for *critiques* of her work
	1. as a way to present Chinese myths in her stories
	1. as a method of engaging children who are not yet reading on their own

Preciosite, "preciousness." or the manifestation of the baroque in literature, is **often dismissed** as a "*feminine* concoction," mocked by Molière and thought to be ridiculous by modern standards. Preferring appearance to substance and excess to moderation, baroque expression is given to wild exaggeration and *purple* description. However, when one **considers its historical context, the movement can be seen as a subtle rebellion by an otherwise powerless sex** against its restrictive society.

Crippled and stunned from a series of religious wars, seventeenth-century France under Louis XIII was characterized by political intrigue and violence. Escaping the crude court, a group of cultured and educated ladies met to discuss- in a fantastically embellished and witty manner- literature, art, and philosophy. They rejected the predominant emphasis on *vulgarity* and sought the elevation of "education", or "manners" they considered essential to society. More salons followed, and these prgcieuses (literally, "precious ones") produced works of literature that are still widely read, such as novels, essays, and poems that elevated the ideal of courtly, or Platonic, love with an emphasis on *sensuality* and scrupulous rules of behavior.

Though men scoffed at their wives' pretensions, baroque literature as a reaction to political instability reawakened French *proclivities* for cultural expression. When Louis XIV ascended to the throne in 1661, French society was *primed* for the reestablishment of the arts. Baroque ideals served important roles regarding the criticism of the political situation and the influence of cultural trends. Louis XIV's peace provoked the cultural pendulum to swing to the other direction, ushering in a neo-classical movement that elevated simplicity and minimalism. It is surely no coincidence that it was the performance of "Les Precieuses Ridicules" ("The Conceited Ladies"). Moliere's play mocking preciosite, that first gained him wide acclaim and established him as the preeminent father of French theater.

9. The primary purpose of the passage is to
	1. demonstrate the importance of the role of a specific artistic movement to a culture
	1. show that **women had a greater influence** on history than was previously thought
	1. define and explain the origins of an **obscure art form**
	1. correct a commonly held historical **misconception about the origins** of a literary movement
	1. emphasize the **influence of a nation's ruler** on its arts and culture

10. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The author suggests which of the following about how preciosite was viewed during the seventeenth century?
	1. It became the preferred method of communication for all members of French society.
	1. It was tolerated until Moliere's popular play mocked it.
	1. [O] Its importance as a cultural force was not understood.

11. Select the sentence that most concisely describes the contrast between preciosite and the neo-classicism that followed it.
	- Preferring appearance to substance and excess to moderation, baroque expression is given to wild exaggeration and purple description

12. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The author suggests which of the following about how the preciosite was viewed during the seventeenth century?
	1. [O] Literature can be a weapon of protest.
	1. [?] Before the seventeenth century, the French expressed themselves through the arts.
	1. Literature was the only means of protest available to women in the seventeenth century.

The mid-nineteenth century witnessed two major wars on U.S. soil: the Mexican-American War and the Civil War. That Abraham Lincoln would commit the country to civil war appears to require little explanation, since he endorsed the abolition of slavery and the preservation of the young nation. **However, Lincoln's disdain for the Mexican-American War, which was ostensibly fought to keep Texas in the Union, requires some examination.** After all, Lincoln's swift military response to the Southern secessionists at the beginning of the Civil War illustrates that Lincoln would not shrink from battle if the war could ensure a united country. Perhaps Lincoln's resistance to the Mexican-American War can best be seen in light of his sincere belief that President Polk had *overstepped* his constitutional boundaries in declaring war against Mexico, a sovereign nation. In this light, it is perhaps ironic that Lincoln's own presidential legacy includes a greater centralization of federal government power.

13. Which of the following best describes the function of the sentence about Lincoln's swift military response in the passage?
	1. It **provides evidence** that Lincoln generally did not oppose wars.
	1. It explains that Lincoln, despite his **pacifist tendencies**, was not convinced that the Mexican-American War effort was wrong.
	1. It confirms that Lincoln's belief in the wisdom of entering a war was formulated on the basis of what is good for a united counties.
	1. [O] It suggests that Lincoln's opinions on the Mexican-American War were not based solely on a belief in unification.
	1. It illustrates that **opponents of United States foreign policy** within the federal government convinced Lincoln to enter the Civil War.

14. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ According to the passage, which of the following is true of the Mexican-American War?
	1. [O] Lincoln did not initiate the war.
	1. [O] Lincoln would have disagreed with President Polk about its legality.
	1. it was fought ostensibly to abolish slavery.

**Country music scholars generally overlook the role that African-Americans** played in the formation of this genre. Typically, scholars trace the birth of country music to the recording sessions that record producer and talent scout Ralph Peer held in Bristol, Tennessee, in 1927. However, the origins of country music go back much further and owe a great deal to African-American musicians, some known and some anonymous and *unheralded*. **The *banjo*, *field hollers*, and gospel music are examples of country genre *staples* that are rooted in the African-American experience**. Moreover, some of the "stars" of country music learned their trade from African- American musicians. Rufus "Tee Tot" Payne, for instance, educated Hank Williams. In addition to jazz, gospel, and the blues, country music now clearly needs to be included in the list of musical genres that have an African-American lineage.

15. According to the passage, the "African-American experience" is crucial to country music because other previously established African-American genres
	1. [O] provided the instrumental and vocal basis for country music
	1. were not as well developed as country music
	1. preceded country music
	1. weakened the popularity of country music
	1. were more accepted and conventional than country music

16. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements concerning the contributions of African- Americans to country music?
	1. Rufus "Tee Tot" Payne is responsible for teaching Hank Williams the banjo, field holler, and gospel.
	1. [O] African-Americans were *instrumental* in developing country music and for teaching it to some of the well-known musicians in the field.
	1. [O] Jazz music is commonly acknowledged to have African-American lineage.

Many scholars consider Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past (1913-1927) a significant literary achievement. For instance, Harold Bloom states that it is "widely recognized as the major novel of the twentieth century." In addition to noting its length-it spans seven volumes and 3,200 pages-**many commentaries have focused on Proust's treatment of two kinds of memory, involuntary and voluntary**. Involuntary memory occurs through the stimulation of the senses, while voluntary memory is a deliberate effort to remember the past. **For Proust, involuntary memories are superior** because they contain the spirit of the past in a way that voluntary memories do not; **the former are more vivid, and they have the power to erase the temporal distance between the present moment and past experiences.** More recently, scholars such as Andre Benhaim have explored the relationship between Proust's treatment of memory and his representation of France and French culture. According to Benhaim, memory functions within this text to reconfigure both.

Proust describes France in ways that one would not expect. In his work, French cities are archaic and exotic. As a result, the narrator becomes a stranger to, or is estranged from, his homeland, and lives the life of an exile. For instance, when recalling his travels through the fictional French town of Balbec, he states. "These strangely ordinary and disdainfully familiar *cathedrals* cruelly stunned my *unconsidered* eyes and stabbed my homesick heart." Words such as "stun" and "stab" suggest the hostility the narrator feels from this French territory. Proust's suggestion of Middle Eastern influences further distorts the idea of a singular French experience. First, the town's name refers to the ancient city of Baalbek, located in what is now Lebanon. Second, Balbec is populated by Jewish residents. **Proust is widely recognized as an icon of French literature and culture**, but ultimately his mysterious representations of this place and its culture call into question the existence of a single Francophone literature or a single French identity.

17. The author uses the quotation from Remembrance of Things Past in order to
	1. illustrate how Proust's concept of involuntary memory
	1. [O] exemplify an assertion regarding the narrator's relationship to his homeland, which the author mentions in the preceding sentence
	1. mark a turning point in the passage in which the author switches from describing life in France to exploring Proust's representation of it
	1. bolster Proust's disdain for reliance on personal memories when returning to the locales of childhood
	1. dissuade the reader from accepting Proust's characterizations of voluntary memory

18. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ The passage refers to which of the following as a feature of the French town of Balbec, as Proust represents it?
	1. *mausoleums*
	1. *itinerants*
	1. churches

19. Select the sentence from the second paragraph in which the author summarizes Prousts description of France.
	- In his work, French cities are archaic and exotic.

20. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ It can be inferred that Benhaim might agree with which of the following statements about the role of memory in Remembrance of Things Past?
	1. The study of memory in Prousts novel is the most important approach to this text and has led to valuable **insights regarding the human condition**.
	1. [O] The study of Prousts exploration of memory is a useful starting place with which to consider other issues, such as French culture and traditions.
	1. While the study of memory in Prousts novel once yielded interesting insights into the workings of the human mind, new approaches to this text have proven more useful.
