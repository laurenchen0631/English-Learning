"Solar wind" is the term scientists use to describe the stream of particles that the sun's *corona* constantly emits. These solar winds, which consist mainly of hydrogen and helium, are intensely hot, fully ionized plasma. Because of the corona's intense heat, these particles continuously escape the sun's gravitational attraction, flowing away from the sun at extreme velocities. Solar winds, though, are not without variation, because **they contain faster and slower moving *pockets*.** For instance, solar winds that originate from *streamers* are slower moving winds at approximately 300 km/second, as opposed to the winds that originate from *corona holes* and reach speeds of 800 km/second. As they flow away from the sun. tangential discontinuities and interplanetary shocks form, producing pressure variations. Moreover, researchers also know that **solar winds are directly related to geomagnetic storms, auroras, and comets**. It is these winds that cause comet tails to bend away from the sun, as Kepler accurately predicted in the early 1600s.

Studies have been done on the effect of solar winds on the planets in the solar system. While all the planets are surrounded by this hot, super-charged plasma, the Earth's magnetic field protects it from the solar wind by deflecting the particles. However, solar winds are responsible for the Earth's magnetosphere, and **changes in their speed and direction strongly influence Earth's space environment.** As the planet closest to the sun. Mercury endures the main impact of solar winds. If Mercury had an atmosphere, these winds would have stripped it away, leaving the planet bathed in radiation. Though Mars is much further from the sun than Mercury, solar winds have also greatly reduced its atmosphere. While Venus has a substantial atmosphere-100 times denser than ours-solar winds reduce its clouds. It is not just those planets nearest the sun which bear the effects of solar winds: The winds travel far beyond the limits of *Pluto*. Interestingly. **while much is now known about solar winds**, scientists still do not fully understand how the gases and particles in the sun's corona reach such high velocities.

1. It can be inferred from the passage that the **Earth's magnetic field** acts to
	1. absorb the particles blown by solar winds
	1. incinerate the particles present in solar winds
	1. *assimilate* the particles in solar winds into the Earth's atmosphere
	1. divert the particles in solar winds from the Earth
	1. re-orient the particles in solar winds toward a central collection point

2. The author most likely discusses Kepler's predictions in order to
	1. [O] illustrate the observable effect solar winds have had on other celestial objects
	1. denounce Kepler's work as unreliable because the technology required to study solar winds directly has only been developed within the last century
	1. describe more generally the first major contribution to the study of solar winds and the sun
	1. disprove Kepler's theories on the motion of comets and auroras
	1. establish a standard against which to compare the observations concerning the atmospheres of Mars and Mercury

3. Select the sentence that attempts to correct a **possible misconception** about the effects of solar winds.
 - It is not just those planets nearest the sun which bear the effects of solar winds: The winds travel far beyond the limits of Pluto

4. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ According to the passage, which of the following is true of the effect of solar winds on the Earth?
	1. [O] Though the Earth's magnetic field largely protects it from the full effects of solar winds, the winds have an impact on its magnetosphere and its space environment.
	1. [O] Solar winds play a **significant** role in the development of auroras and geomagnetic storms in the earth's space environment.
	1. [?] Because of the corona's intense heat, solar wind particles continuously escape the sun's gravitational attraction, flowing away from the corona at extremely high velocities and **surrounding the Earth** with hot, super-charged plasma.

The American people have an incorrect understanding of what it means to be at war. At least, so argues T.H. Pickett in his conservative interpretation of American military history.

Pickett does present a wealth of examples, along with a refreshingly candid argument that America often goes to war for an abstract ideal such as democratization of societies, world peace, liberty, or freedom. For instance, the Spanish-American War of 1898 was *ostensibly* a consequence of national enthusiasm for the cause of Cuban liberty. And. more obviously, America's entry into World War I stemmed from a desire to "make the world safe for democracy." **Although these observations are supportable, Pickett overstates the case** when he argues that these abstract causes typically lead to a war hysteria in which American leadership can no longer enforce any measured policies.

5. Which of the following best states the author's main point?
	1. Pickett's study overturned the conventional understanding of why America engages in warfare.
	1. Pickett's study is valuable primarily because it provides a thorough understanding of the causes of American warfare.
	1. The rationale for American warfare is well documented.
	1. Pickett provides a cogent rationale for why America engages in warfare; however, he draws conclusions that the author does not fully support.
	1. Pickett's analysis of American military history provides the definitive historical record of the period from the Spanish-American War to World War I.

6. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ It can be inferred from the description of Pickett's work that the author believes which of the following?
	1. [O] The desire for tangible rewards is not always the primary reason that America enters into warfare.
	1. [O] Democratization of a foreign country was a rationale for at least one war that America has waged.
	1. [O] Pickett provides a large number of examples to bolster his case.

Some readers categorize Maxine Hong Kings-ton as a great Asian-American writer, a classification that is ultimately too narrow for her body of work. However, the subject matter of Kingston's novels and autobiographies espouses the Asian immigrant experience, as the following characters suggest: immigrant laborers in California and Hawaii, railroad laborers, and Chinese doctors. In natural harmony with her choice of subject matter are the personal sensibilities of a first-generation American writer who endeavors to explain her mother's alien sensibility and her relationship with her silent, angry father.

Kingston's Asian influences are present in another type of work. Chinese myths in the guise of "talk stories." A character in her novel Tripmaster Monkey is based on Sun Wu Kong, a mythical Chinese figure. In response to this work. Herbert Gold notes that the author "invigorates her novel with an avid personal perspective, doing what the novel is supposed to do-she brings us the news of the world and makes magic of it."

7. The author focuses on the content of Kingston's work primarily to
	1. [O] illustrate why one might be tempted to call Kingston an Asian-American author
	1. assert why Kingston's work is difficult to categorize
	1. explain why Kingston's work is thought by many to have universal appeal
	1. illustrate how Kingston's work is affected by her parental influences
	1. show what makes Kingston unique among Asian-American writers

8. __Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.__ It can be inferred that Kingston uses "talk stories"
	1. to provide an outlet for critiques of her work
	1. as a way to present Chinese myths in her stories
	1. as a method of engaging children who are not yet reading on their own
