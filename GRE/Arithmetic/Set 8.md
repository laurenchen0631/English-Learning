## Questions

3. A power station is located on the boundary of a square region that measures 10 miles on each side. Three substations are located inside the square region.
- Quantity A: The sum of the distances from the power station to each of the substations
- Quantity B: 30 miles
	1. The quantity in Column A is greater
	1. The quantity in Column B is greater
	1. The two quantities are equal.
	1. The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.

6. A and B are independent events in a probability experiment such that P(A)=P(B) and P(A)+P(B)=1.
- Quantity A: P(AorB)
- Quantity B: 3P(AandB)
	1. Quantity A is greater.
	1. Quantity B is greater.
	1. [O] The two quantities are equal.
	1. The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.

19. If j and k are integers and j - k is even, which of the following must be even?
	1. k
	1. jk
	1. j+2k
	1. [O] jk+j
	1. jk-2j

## Review
3. Max：当3个变电站无限接近左下角的时候是最大值，即正方形的对角线10*根号2，那么sum=30*根号2≈42.4mile
- Min：当3个变电站无限接近右上角的时候是最小值，即sum≈0mile ∴0＜sum＜42.4mile，无法判断大小D

6. 题目条件可知 P(A) = P(B) = 0.5
- AB为独立事件，P（AandB）=P(A) P(B) = 0.25 
- P（AorB）= P(A) +P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.5+0.5-0.25 = 0.75
- 3 * P（AandB）= 0.75所以AB相等，选C。

19. 由 j - k 為偶數可知，如果 j, k 同為奇數或偶數 
	1. x
	2. 偶數相乘為偶數
	3. 2k 為偶數
	4. jk + j = j(k+1)，j與k+1互為奇數偶數，因此相乘後為奇數
	5. jk - 2j = j(k-2)，k-2 奇數偶數不變，因此奇數相成後為奇數
