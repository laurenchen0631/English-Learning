	1. [O] The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.

17. At 12:00 noon a hose began draining water from a pool at a constant rate of 120 ounces per minute. At 2:00 that afternoon, an additional hose began draining water from the pool, increasing the constant rate at which the water was being drained to 240 ounces per minute. The pool was empty before 4:30 that afternoon. Which of the following could have been the amount of water, in ounces, in the pool at 12:00 noon that day?
	1. [O] 42,640
	1. [O] 46,080
	1. [O] 50,250
	1. 52,540
	1. 55,320

20. A product is on sale for a discounted price that is 20 percent less than its regular price. The regular price is what percent greater than the discounted price?
	- 25%

## Review
5. 题目问的意思是，在等式中，每个x的值对应的y值的个数是几个，显然一个x值只对应一个y值，因此是B大

6. 做差A-B=x/（1-x）
	- 当 x>1时，A-B<0, A < B
	- 当0 < x < 1时，A-B > 0 ,A < B
	- 当x = 0时，A - B = 0, A = B
	- 当x < 0时，A-B < 0, A < B

17. 120 * 120 + 240 * 150 = 50400

20. 100 / 80 - 1 = 0.25
