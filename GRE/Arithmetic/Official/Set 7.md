7. c and d are positive integers.
- Quantity A:c/d
- Quantity B:c+3/d+3
	1. Quantity A is greater.

	1. [O] The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.

8. A rectangular garden has a perimeter of 92 meters. If the length of the garden is 1 meter greater than twice its width, what is the length of the garden, in meters?
	1. 15
	1. 23
	1. 30
	1. [O] 31
	1. 62

12. A dealership purchased a car and a truck and then sold them both. The purchasing cost of the truck was $8,000 greater than the purchasing cost of the car, and the selling price of the truck was $12,000 greater than the selling price of the car. The profit that the dealership made on the car was equal to 20 percent of its purchasing cost, and the profit that the dealership made on the truck was equal to 30 percent of its purchasing cost. If x is the purchasing cost, in dollars, of the car, then x satisfies which of the following equations? (Note: Profit equals selling price minus purchasing cost.)
	1. 0.3x+8,000=0.2x+12,000
	1. 1.3x+8,000=1.2x+12,000
	1. 0.3(x+8,000)=0.2x+12,000
	1. 1.3(x+8,000)=1.2x+12,000
	1. 1.3(x+8,000)+12,000=1.2x

19. Set S consists of the integers of the form r^2 + s, where r and s are integers such that 1 <= s, r <= 5. How many integers in S are odd?
	1. 9
	1. 10
	1. 11
	1. 12
	1. 13

## Review
7. 題目沒有指定 c, d 大小關係，因此無法確定
8. 由代數得知 width = 15, 因此 length = 2 * 15 + 1 = 31
12. x = purchase price of car, y = purchase price of truck
	- y - x = 8000 => y = x + 8000
	- 1.3y - 1.2x = 12000 => 1.3 (x + 8000) - 1.2x = 12000
	- 1.3 (x + 8000) = 1.2x + 12000 => 选项D
19. 全部的可能有12種組合，但是 r=1,s=4 與 r = 2,s=1 數字重複因此 12 - 1
