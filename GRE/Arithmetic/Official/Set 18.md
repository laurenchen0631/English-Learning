	1. 140

## Review
5. 18m的最小正數平方為36, m = 2, 9n的最小正數立方為27, n = 3

6. 直接看(25!)(25!) < (24!)(26!) --> 25 < 26, 做倒數後 50!/(25!)(25!) 比較大

9. 投票情況共有四種 RYSY(R,S都選yes), RYSN(R選yes,N選no), RNSY, RNYN, 題目表示 RYSN = 750, RNSY = 310, 且 R 投 yes 的人數是 S 投 yes 的人數的兩倍。換作變數即為 (RYSY + RYSN) = 2(RYSY + RNSY) --> RYSY = RYSN - 2RNSY = 750 - 2*310 = 130
