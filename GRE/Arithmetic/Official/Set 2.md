## Review
1. 因 (n+7)^2−49 = n^2 + 14n + 49 - 49 = n^2 + 14n 所以除以n後的餘數皆為0
5. 标准差，其实就是每一个数与平均值的离散程度（紧凑程度）；
	- 情况一：450-250，2000+250 :数据更扩散了，有两个数值飞向了离平均数更远的地方 ∴变动后的标准差>错误数列的标准差
	- 450+250，2000-250 ∵数据更紧凑了，这两个数值飞回向了离平均数更近的地方 那么，因为题目没有给定哪个数变大了，哪个数变小了
6. 最小的5個數字為 1, 2, [12], 13, 14 其總和剛好為42
7. 40%通過初試，初試參加者 30% 被錄取，因此 x * 0.4 * 0.3 = 18 --> x = 150
17. x (1 + 0.05 * 9/12) = 26145 --> x = 25200 --> x (1 + 0.06 * 10/12)
20. 箱线图 最左邊跟最右邊的線分別代表最大最小值, 方塊的左中右的直線分別25%, 50%(中位數), 75% 的位置
	2. 数轴上画的一定是fit to scale 的
	3. 四分位即為25%~75%間的範圍
