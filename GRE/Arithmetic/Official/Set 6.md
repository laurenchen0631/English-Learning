## Review
14. 由表2， average rating总值最低的是C公司，由表1饼图，C被列为第一的是22 agents, 可知 22/100 = 11/50 

16. total of the ratings given to all three airlines for reliability: (7.8+7.5+4.9)*100 = 2020
- total of the ratings given to all three airlines for promptness: (6.5+6.9+4.1)*100 = 1750
- 2020-1750 = 270 which approximately equal to 250
