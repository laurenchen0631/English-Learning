## General
- To get a squared number which ends with 5, we slice 5 from the number and multiple it with its increment with 1, and postfix the result with 25.
	- 35^2 = (3 * 4), 25 = 1225
	- 75 * 75 = (7 * 8), 25 = 5625
	- 115 * 115 = (11 * 12), 25 = 13225
- To get (n+1)^2, if we know n^2, we add n and (n+1) to n^2, and then the result will be (n+1)^2
	- n^2 + n + n + 1 = (n+1)^2
	- 41^2 = 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 1681
	- 69^2 = 70^2 - 70 - 69 = 4761
	- 84^2 = 85^2 - 85 - 84 = 7225 - 169 = 7056

## Number
- Real Number: any number on the number line including fraction/decimal, which can be positive, negative, or zero.
- Zero (0) is neither positive nor negative.
- Integer: All positive and negative **whole number**. {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
- sum: the result of addition
- difference: the result of subtraction
- product: the result of multiplication
- quotient: the result of division
- numerator: a/b, a is numerator
- denominator: a/b, b is denominator
- absolute value: the distance of a number from the origin. |0| = 0

## Fraction
- if a > b and a&b are numerator, then (a/c) > (b/c)
- if p > q and p&q > 0 and are denominator. then (s/p) < (s/q)
- Cross multiplication: a/b = c/d --> ad = bc
- Comparison using cross multiplication
	- (7/11) ? (5/8) --> 56 ? 55 --> (7/11) > (5/8)
	- (9/20) ? (4/9) --> 81 > 80 --> (9/20) > (4/9)
