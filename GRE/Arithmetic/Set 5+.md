## Review
1. 问的是值域range，所以都不能确定具体数值（可能6月份从70F~90F，7月从80F~105F，这样两个月的range就是70F~105F，35）（但也可能6月份80F~100F，7月80F~105F，这样range就是80F~105F则是25），所以不能确定选D

3. x = 5，36x 的質因數為2, 3, 5，因此AB相等

6. 公式：多边形总对角线数为n(n-3)/2条，n为多边形的边数。其中平行的一共是4 * 2 (每2条边对应2条平行) = 8所以A = 8, B = 20 - 8 = 12大

9. 内切正方形有很多个，连接正方形四条边上的四个点，会得到一个四边形和四个三角形，只要这四个三角形是全等的，这个内切四边形就是正方形，正方形的面积为大的正方形减去四个三角形，由于三角形是全等的，所以一个三角形的直角边之和等于10，所以当两条直角边的相等都是5时，三角形的面积最大，此时内切四边形的面积最小，此时四个点在大正方形的中点，内接正方形的面积为： 10 X 10（大正方形）-5X5/2（一个三角形） X 4 = 50

10. 0.025x1150=28.75, 0.035x1150=40.25, 在这之间都可以选

12. T庫存90台電視，售出 50 * 0.9 = 45 台左右，而R庫存40台，售出 40 * 0.5 = 20台，兩者差距百分比為 (45-20) / 45 = 5/9 = 0.555 

19. 800000 * (1-0.15) * (1 + 0.15) = 782,000

20. x<2/3y; x<4/3z; y<2z. so x<y; x<,=,>z; y<,=,>z
