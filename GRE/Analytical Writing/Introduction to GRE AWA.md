## General
- The average AWA score of a GRE test taker worldwide is a mere 4.0
- The Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) portion of the GRE consists of two essays: **Analysis of an Issue** and **Analysis of an Argument**
- **The AWA only tests how well you can write an essay**, and hence measures only your writing abilities. **Contrary to popular opinion, the AWA does not analyze your thought process.** As long as your essay sounds logical, writing ability is all it measures. 
- The AWA score ranges between 0 and 6.0, with 0.5 point increments, with 6 being the highest score and 1, the lowest.
	- 6.0 Outstanding: 
		- Clearly identifies and analyzes the most important features of the argument **with deep insight**.
		- Develops **cogent** ideas, organizes them logically, and **connects them properly without sudden transitions**.
		- Supports the main points of the critique strongly.
		- Demonstrates superior control of the English language, including **diction, sentence formation, spelling, grammar and syntactic variety** used in standard written English.
		- Few to no flaws in the essay.
	- 5.0 Strong
		- Clearly identifies the important features of the argument and analyzes them **thoughtfully**.
		- Develops ideas **clearly**, and connects them logically, with appropriate transitions.
		- Gives a very sensible support to the main points of the critique.
		- Has **clear control of language**, including diction and syntactic variety
		- May have **minor flaws like spelling errors**, but **no major flaws.**
	- 4.0 – Adequate
		- **Capable of Identifying and analyzing** the main features of the argument.
		- Develops and organizes ideas satisfactorily, but some important connections and **transitions may be missing.**
		- **Supports the main points** of the critique.
		- Demonstrates sufficient control of language, but may **lack syntactic variety.**
		- May have many minor flaws or some major flaws.
	- 3.0 – Limited
		1. Does **not identify or analyze** many of the important features of the argument.
		1. Has **limited logical development** and no proper organization of ideas.
		1. Offers support of **little relevance and value for points** of the critique
		1. Uses **language imprecisely** and/or lacks sentence variety
		1. Contains occasional major errors or frequent minor errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics
- Evaluation:
	1. Two readers will read your Issue essay and assign it a deserving score and two different readers will read your Argument essay and assign it a score. 
	2. If the grades given by the two readers differ by more than a point, a third, highly experienced grader is brought in to resolve the discrepancy
	3. A final score is the average of the scores assigned by the two readers or the adjusted score assigned by the third reader.
	4. Your final AWA score will be the average of your scores on Issue and Argument essays
- Points:
	1. Clarity
		- the grader can spend a maximum of only two minutes per essay, and the grader should understand what you are trying to say, by reading once.
		- it is your duty to make sure your essays have clearly composed ideas.
		- Ask yourselves these two questions when you are writing the essays. **What are you trying to say? What’s your main point?**
			- Just like how you can easily solve a Reading Comprehension question, graders assessing your essay will also need to find answers to these exact same questions
	2. Structure
		- It is the second most important factor on your essays.
		- The way an article is formatted, has a massive impact upon its readability. Your essays should read like a story
		- **Every paragraph reads like a separate story**, and the essay graders can easily scan through your entire response easily.
		- The transitions are smooth, and there aren’t any sudden twists in your response
		- The general structure is to start with an introductory paragraph followed by 3-4 body paragraphs and finish off with a conclusion paragraph. 
		- **GRE Issue Essay and GRE Argument Essay are very different in nature, and hence you need different strategies to tackle them.**
	3. Sentence Variety
		- You should ideally **avoid writing similar or same sentences**. No good writer under the sun writes two exactly same sentences in a single essay or article
		- It simply means that you should **use a different variety of words** to mean the same thing.
			- For example For, ‘The most important virtue of a leader is a strong sense of ethics.’, you should rephrase like this: ‘A strong moral framework is paramount for any leader.’ Get the point?
		- Keep varying the sentence structures, flow and rhythm by **switching between short and long sentences**.
		- Make use of **transitional and signal words** to vary sentence openings and endings.
	4. ~~Vocabulary~~
		- **AWA only tests how logically you can deduce information** and write a reasonable critique about an issue or an argument made by someone else
		- It is **not needed that you use heavy vocabulary or GRE words.**
	5. Language and Grammar
		- Even though **the mistakes or errors** do not interfere with overall meaning and coherence, you should understand that the time you make your first error on the essay, the grader will notice it, and will be more conscious while reading the rest of the copy. 
		- The grader will be even more vigilant to see if there are any visible or obvious blunders that you have made, and this can have a negative impact on your AWA score. So, try and make sure your essay is as spotless as possible
		- Don’t be in a hurry to submit it off and skip to the next section.
		- It is important to remember that you **should only use words you actually know.** Sometimes, students might not know the exact meaning, or even worse, the spelling of a big word that they heard somewhere, but they still go ahead and use it in a sentence.
		- Unlike MS Word or other desktop word processors, **there is no spell check or grammar check** available on the GRE AWA. So, don’t hurt your score by using words whose spellings you don’t know.
	6. Reasoning
		- Always look to **include as many logically compelling reasons** as you can to support your stance.
		- One of the most important features about a compelling essay is its ability to **convince the reader by means of sound logical reasoning**. 
		- Ideally, you should be able to connect your ideas properly to the central theme or idea of the essay, and convince the reader to agree to your point of view. 
	7. Evidence
		- In order to make your essay sound reasonable and logically sound, you will obviously **need to provide sufficient evidences.**
		- Search for evidences, either direct or implied, and connect them with the essay. You **can even create some random examples and evidences,** as long as they fit the bill and don’t sound too random.
	8. Length
		- The essay graders are aware that you only get 30 minutes and you won’t be able to cover every possible argument, reason and rebuttal.
		- Most GRE test takers won’t be able to find time to cover everything they would like to cover on the test.
		- **ETS has not spoken out about the ideal length of an essay**, and there is no word on the word limit as such.
		- When closely observed, there is a significant increase in the number of words from a 5.0 graded essay and a 6.0 graded essay. **The reality is, longer essay is usually better.**  If you are a long-essay fan and insist to pen a high scoring AWA essay on the GRE, **you should write anywhere between 500-600 words.** 600 is an upper limit for word count. **If you go beyond 600 words, you can see how the scores go down**.
- Essay Topics
	- Each and every essay topic that shows up on the real test is already published on the official ETS website. **There are close to 200 topics in all** – far too many to practice responses in advance.
	- Most of the topics that show up on the GRE Essay section can be broadly grouped into five categories:
		1. Education
		2. Arts
		3. Government/Politics
		4. Philosophy
		5. Sciences and Technology
	-  How do I get ideas for the essay:
		1. A large number of issue and argument prompts on the official essay pool are hard to understand correctly. And when you don’t understand something, how can you write about that something?
		- You should **keep a few related examples for each one of the categories** as they will be handy and save you precious time on the test day.
		- the essay prompts are full of obscure vocabulary and hence are hard to comprehend. Thus, you should **give every essay a read through. While reading, you should also make note of all the unfamiliar words and later learn them.**
- How to Finish an Essay in 20 Minutes:
	1. Finish off Introduction and Conclusion First
		- You first outline your essay before you start writing it. So, by the time you are about to start penning down your response, you will have already figured out what you want to write in the introduction, how you want to start off, and how you want to end the conclusion.
		- Finish these two very important paragraphs as early as you can, **preferably in the first 5 minutes.**
		- Now, if you can do this well, you can easily write each body paragraph in 5 minutes.
	2. Always Be Negative
		- Even though we asked you to pick a thesis , you should know that if you want to save time, you will have to try and stay on the negative side
		- **It takes no time for us to point out mistakes in others**, while it takes a lot of thinking and courage to appreciate something that is controversial. And given the incredibly limited time that you have on your hands, **it will be easier for you to criticize the author’s point of view, than to take his/her side.**
		- You should believe that whatever the author has written is false, no matter how logical it may seem. This sort of thinking will help you brainstorm the relevant points quickly.
	3. Attack the Assumptions
		- In both the Issue and the Argument essay questions, the author will have made multiple assumptions in order to come to a particular conclusion. It is your job now to attack the very assumption that the author makes.
	4. Don’t Be A Perfectionist
		- A better strategy is to keep writing even though you make mistakes, as once you think you are done with the writing part, then you can start proofreading your copy for mistakes and small errors.
	5. Use the Scratch Paper
	6. Practice Typing
		- Considering the fact that you will take about 2-3 minutes to read and understand the given question, another 2-3 minutes to figure out what you want to write, and another couple of minutes to outline your essay, you will be left with **roughly 20 minutes to write a 600 word essay.**
		- Considering the fact that you should **save some time to proofread your essay**, you should probably be able to type around 600 words in 15 minutes, which means, **200 words every 5 minutes.**
	7. Practice Keyboard Shortcuts
		- You’ll have basic keyboard functions, plus three other features: cut, copy, paste, and undo.
	8. Practice! Practice! Practice!
	9. Read The Entire AWA Question Pool
		- You could probably finish them all in a month or two.
- Mistakes You Should Avoid:
	1. Writing a cliché ridden essay: you should try and be a bit different, a bit unique. Using the same examples that everyone uses really won’t help you much.
	2. Not citing the original author
	3. Writing mixed-up paragraphs: you must allocate separate paragraphs for every idea or point that you are writing about.
	4. Giving away too much in the intro: The key to writing exceptional essays is to keep the reader intrigued until the last word.
	5. Using irrelevant examples: Sometimes **it is fine to make up your own examples**, but remember that they should be very relevant to the rest of the essay.
	6. Not summarizing effectively: A perfect conclusion paragraph not only **includes the main idea or point of view** that you chose to side with, but also has **a neat summary of all the points** that have already been discussed in the previous paragraphs.
	7. Introducing new points in the conclusion: Be content with what you have already written.
	8. Writing immediately
	9. Not ideating correctly: An improper presentation, or a poorly organized idea will only make your essay sound more amateur that anything else.
	10. Taking too much time for ideation: Almost all the essays you will see on the GRE are quite simple to criticize.
	11. Not sticking to one side
	12. Not using templates/structure: If you can’t make good use of them, at least try to create your own organization or structure. 
	13. Not being specific enough: Whichever side you choose to take, or whatever point you are trying to make, be specific.
	14. Using complex words just for the sake of using
	15. Not using transitional words
	16. Not sounding confident enough: Using words such as ‘I think’, ‘in my opinion’, ‘perhaps’, ‘Maybe’, etc., will give the reader the impression that you are not confident enough to put your ideas forth.
	17. Using the word ‘I’ very often
	18. Using the same sentence structure over and over again: try to rephrase the same sentences and write something else that means the same. Like many other things in life, this comes with a lot of practice.
	19. **Not including a counter argument**: Given the fact that almost all essays come from a wide range of topics, and that they don’t need any special prior knowledge, it would be bad if you cannot counter the author’s deliberately wrong point of view along with your two cents.
	20. Contradicting yourself: ometimes, when writing the third or the fourth paragraphs, test takers contradict their own opinions or points of view that they put forward in the first one or two paragraphs.
	21. Focusing a lot on grammar and vocabulary: **Write whatever you can and as much as you can**. Do not bother about silly grammatical errors or workaday vocabulary. **Once you think you are done with writing, then go back and read everything, correct those grammatical mistakes, or replace those boring words** with good vocabulary.
	22. Writing unnecessarily long sentences: Don’t try to use filler words or phrases so you could increase the word count. Quality trumps quantity any day.
	23. Using slang language.
	24. **Attacking the issue task as if it’s an argument**: make sure you don’t get confused between the two essay formats or structures, and that you have a clear understanding of both the question types.
	25. Not leaving time for proofreading:
- Essay Grade Tools
	1. ETS Score It Now!: For a small amount of $13 dollars, the ETS Essay Grader will grade two of your essays. **No feedback.**
	2. Friends, Family, and Experts
		- Before you let your friends or family judge your essays, you should tell them beforehand that you only had 30 minutes to write your essay, and so they should not expect you to write an award-winning piece
	3. Self-Evaluation
		- Self-evaluation, though most of the time not recommended, can be a really useful option for you.
		- There are **hundreds of mock essays on the internet**, and with a simple google search, you can get access to various essays for the GRE. Also, **most mock essays usually have an explanation at the end**, which explain why they have been given their respective scores.
		- If you can compare your response with those on the internet, you can roughly estimate whether your answer is closer to the 4.0 or the 5.0 sample.
		-  If you can do this a lot of times, you will begin to see a definite pattern, which can help you estimate your average AWA score.
	4. Internet
		- There are many GRE forums like [Urch](https://www.urch.com/forums/gre/), [PaGaLGuY](), etc
	5. [GMATAWA.com](http://gmatawa.com)
		- It was developed to grade GMAT AWA essays, but rest assured, there’s not much difference between GMAT and GRE AWA essays.
		- The grading happens instantaneously, and as soon as you submit your essay, you will receive a composite AWA score, along with various metrics on which your essay has been graded.
		- Other than ETS Score It Now, this is probably the most accurate AWA rater you will see, and you can expect a similar AWA score on your exam as well
		- The website allows you to **grade only 10 essays per email address.**


## Analyze an Issue
- The GRE Issue Essay requires you to **construct and support your opinions on a particular ‘issue’** that has been given to you,
- Points:
	1. View: yours
		- **Present an argument with your views, and your ability to convince the reader to agree** to your point of view.
		- **Include your own views and add valuable points** to your response, in order for the reader to be convinced to agree with you.
	2. Topic: General
		- The debatable topic that has been given to you to analyze, is very general in nature and can be from any field. It hence **doesn’t usually require you to have a very deep knowledge** of the topic.
		- The issue is simply **provided as a statement, and your job is to pick a side, stick to it** until the end without fiddling around, and present your points of view, your analysis, and your final conclusions in a suitable manner.
	3. Direction
		- The directions given for an Issue Essay are entirely different from the Argument Essay, and the Issue Essay can be **accompanied with a varied set of instructions, and there is no one particular direction** for you to follow
	4. Conclusion: yours
		- You must be able to introduce the issue at hand in your own words briefly, using your own conclusion
	5. Second Paragraph: reasons
		- You should be stating the side you have chosen, and also your reasons for standing by it
	6. Example: Real
		- The body paragraphs (paragraphs 2, 3, and 4) must definitely involve relevant real world examples that support your chosen claim
		- Remember that the examples you provide must not only **be relevant**, but they must **be real world**, true examples. Which means, you **cannot create examples out of thin air**, on your own.
	7. Conclusion Statement: Appreciating
		- The conclusion statement involves **agreeing with the opposing viewpoint in one or two statements.** You should do this in order to show your emotional maturity level.
	8. Liberty
		- You have the liberty use anything and everything to support your claim.
		- you may use any evidences to support your statements, even if they say that the conclusion is wrong.
	9. Evidence
		- The Issue Essay depends on outside, credible facts, because there are no evidences provided within the issue. 
		- you should go search for your own evidences, and decide if you want to support or question the conclusion made by the author. 
- Steps:
	1. Read the Essay
		- You must perform a ‘smart read’. A smart read is where you **read the prompt and figure out the central issue,** and jot down this issue on your scratch paper, **including some of the important concepts** from the given topic.
		- It is a lot easier to pen down whatever you have understood from reading the prompt **in your own words.**
		- After reading the given issue, and **writing it down in a few concise words**, you should be able to understand exactly what the issue is and also what some of the crucial concepts related to that issue are.
	2. Brainstorm Reasons and Examples
		- **This step is where most of the heavy lifting gets done.** So, make sure you spend adequate time on this step.
		- After you’ve written down the central issue and the key concepts, you should ideally **make a “pro” and “con” list on the scratch paper.** Once you have enough reasons to pick a side, you can move further. 
		- You should **think about how your personal experiences relate to the issue** at hand. Think about things you have observed or experienced in daily life, read about in magazines or newspapers, or even heard about from your family members and friends.
		- Next, you should be coming up with some examples of your own. *Don’t spend more than two or three minutes* on this part because *you can still write a good essay without perfect examples*.
		- *If you start writing without thinking* through the issue or planning the structure of your essay, you run the *risk of wasting time on editing and re-editing* your points. Or even worse, you might reach a dead end and there is no more evidence left with you to substantiate your point of view, but you’ve already spent 20 minutes.
	3. Pick a Thesis
		- You will have to pick a proper thesis based on which you will write your opinion.
		- This is because **you don’t have to actually believe the position** you write about; sometimes, you may disagree with the issue at hand, but find it **easier to come up with examples and reasons for the other side of the argument.**
		- **Just choose whichever thesis allows you to write the strongest essay**. In most cases, you find the “con” side easier to argue. **Don’t mull over it for minutes** together.
		- Your thesis needs to **state why you believe this position is correct.** Take a moment to think about this, and jot your thesis down on your scratch paper
	4. Outline Your Essay
		- Don’t start writing your essay altogether.
		- Figure out what you want to write in the introduction, how you want to start off, and how you want to end the conclusion.
		- Then, figure out what you want to write in the body paragraphs. More importantly, you will have to **consider how to introduce the opposing side of the argument** and how counter it with your point of view
	5. Write Your Response
		- Typical Structure:
			1. Introduction – hook the reader with an amazing intro and state your most important thesis
			1. Agreeing to the given issue
			1. Bringing up the negative side of the issue along with supporting facts and quotes
			1. Building up the negative side further with examples and support
			1. Conclusion
		- Alternative 1
			1. Introduction
			1. First argument for the side you take
			1. Refute your first take and argue for the opposite side
			1. Second argument for the side you take
			1. Refute your take again and argue for the opposite side
			1. Conclusion
		- Alternative 2
			1. Introduction
			1. Argument for your side
			1. Argument against your side
			1. Argument for your side
			1. Argument against your side
			1. Conclusion: evaluate both sides and arrive at thesis
	6. Proofread
		- You should rather focus on improving what you have already written, and try to **spend at least three to four minutes on proofreading** what you have written.


## Analyze an Argument
- The GRE Argument Essay requires you to validate the authenticity, or the logical correctness of an argument that someone else has constructed and **“not to present your own views on the subject!”**
- Points:
	1. View: theirs
		- Requires you to completely **analyze a brief argument written by another author.**
		- Effectively critique the argument or the author’s point of view, by **providing sufficient evidences, and by asking logical questions.**
	2. Topic: Specific
		- The author himself **already presents a case with his/her supporting evidences** in the form of a paragraph. Your job is to **see how logical the argument sounds, and check whether this argument is right or not, whether the argument has been made on solid grounds**.
		- If you choose to substantiate the author’s point of view, you can cite your own examples to strengthen the points.
		- If you wish to go against the given point of view, then you must be able to ask comprehensive questions that check the validity of the evidences provided in the argument.
	3. Direction
		- For example, “Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on the assumptions and what the implications are if the assumptions prove unwarranted.”
	4. Conclusion: theirs
		- The given argument must be introduced from the author’s point of view using his own conclusion. 
		- You should **always be clear on whose conclusion you are taking into consideration:** yours, or the authors. And this depends on whether it is an Issue Essay or an Argument Essay.
	5. Second Paragraph: Flaw
		- You should begins with the **biggest flaw that you have identified** in the argument made by the author. The flaws in the author’s presented argument must be identified before you start writing your response, which makes it easy for you while critiquing the argument.
		- You should also discuss how his conclusion made by the author overlooks this major flaw.
	6. Example: Hypothetical
		- You have the **flexibility to create your own examples, as long as they are relevant to the given topic**, and as long as they efficiently substantiate the argument that you are trying to make.
		- The flaws made by the author that you have identified, must be stated with **explanations and solid examples, which can sometimes be fake, as long as they fit the scenario you are trying to explain.**
	7. Conclusion Statement: Questioning
		- the conclusion statements ends on a note of doubt, where you **claim that the argument may have one or more valid points** but is otherwise entirely flawed, **needs more plausible explanations**, and requires more solid examples for it to be valid.
	8. Limitation
		- You should only prove that **the evidences supporting the conclusion are inadequate, not that the conclusion itself is wrong**. 
		- **The conclusion is always right**, but you should **doubt or question the authenticity of the conclusion**, meaning, ask how the author came to such a conclusion without **sufficient supporting claims.**
- Steps:
	1. Evaluate the Argument
		- Your first task is to **break the argument down into its conclusion and premises**. 
		- Once you have the conclusion and the premises, the next step is to **find the assumptions underlying the argument.**
	2. Brainstorm Assumptions
		- These arguments are usually full of holes, even more so than Critical Reasoning arguments.
		- Look for the common argument patterns: **causal**, **sampling**, and **analogy**.
		- You only need **two or three good assumptions** to construct your essay.
	3. Pick a Thesis
		- Just assume that whatever **assumptions that the author has made have no evidences, and go completely negative on that**, and prepare a thesis in your mind in that direction.
		- Your thesis needs to state why you believe this position is correct. Take a moment to think about this, and jot your thesis down on your scratch paper. 
	4. Outline Your Essay
		- You need to evaluate the strength of these assumptions out which you laid.
		- Generally, the arguments on the GRE are poorly reasoned, so you should basically be **looking for reasons the assumptions fail to lead to the conclusion.**
		-  Think about ways you could weaken and strengthen the argument. 
	5. Write
		- Typical Structure
			1. Introduction: Describe the premise and point out the flaws or state your intention
			1. Detail first assumption; explain problems with it and how to weaken/strengthen the argument
			1. Repeat for second assumption
			1. Repeat for third assumption
			1. Conclusion: Give final evaluation of the validity of the argument
		- Alternative 1
			1. Introduction: Describe the premises, conclusion, and assumptions of the argument
			1. *Weaken the argument by attacking* the assumptions
			1. *Strengthen the argument by bolstering* the assumptions
			1. Conclusion: Present final evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the argument
		- Alternative 2
			1. Introduction
			1. Detail first assumption; explain problems with it and how to weaken/strengthen the argument.
			1. Repeat the same for second assumption.
			1. Repeat the same for third assumption.
			1. Conclusion: Evaluate the strength of the argument based on the assumptions.
	6. Paragraph
		- Introduction: to lay out the basic parts of the argument and let the reader know what the purpose of the essay is.
			1. A statement of the conclusion
			1. A statement of the premises
			1. A statement of the essay’s purpose
		- Body: describe the assumptions necessary to the argument and then critique them. A good critique should **reveal the weaknesses** of the assumptions and also **show how the argument could be strengthened.**
			1. A description of an assumption
			1. An explanation of the weaknesses of the assumption
			1. An evaluation of the conclusion in light of the assumption
		- Conclusion: doesn’t need to do much. All you have to do is make a final evaluation of the soundness of the argument.
	7. Proofread
- Typical False Reasoning:
	1. The Stereotypical Assumption
		- Assuming that characteristics of a group in general apply to each member of that group.
		- We generally think of stereotypes as harmful because they unfairly limit a certain group to a predefined characteristic that often has little to no evidence
		- You should immediately **consider any sentence that generalizes a particular group as plain wrong, and attack that assumption** when you are writing your response.
	2. The Necessity Assumption
		- This is a **very frequent type of false reasoning** that hides in plain sight. Most students simply cannot identify that this type of reasoning is wrong. 
		- The author of an argument usually assumes that a certain condition is necessary to achieve the desired result. But the problem here is, the author simply says that it is necessary to do something to achieve something, and does not provide the necessary evidence.
	3. The Illogical Analogy / Not all x are alike / Apples are not Oranges 
		- Analogy is when someone comes to a conclusion about something on the basis of another thing. For example, if a giant conglomerate has doubled its sales in the last one year because it had spent over $10 million on advertising, then in order for another giant conglomerate to double its sales, it has to spend more than $10 million on advertising.
		- If you think about it carefully, it is an illogical analogy that the author has made in order to prove his/her point. One simply can’t analogize these two scenarios, even though the size of the companies is similar.
	4. The Correlation – Causation Confusion
		- This is one of the **more frequent fallacies** that appear on the AWA argument essays.
		- Many arguments try to **confuse test takers by arguing that correlation and causation are one and the same**. But in fact, they aren’t. 
		- While correlation just means that two events have occurred simultaneously, causation means that one event is the result of another event. Ine should be careful enough to understand that just **because one event happens after another, it doesn’t mean that the first event caused the other to occur.**
	5. The Statistical Irrelevance:
		- While we appreciate any kind of statistical data that further bolsters the author’s point of view, we must also be careful to **analyze the relevance of the statistical data in a particular scenario.**
	6. The Data Bias / Do not trust a survey
		- Sometimes, even though surveys include a large number of people or a certainly large sample space, it is not enough to conclude that the results obtained from the survey are really true. Biased data is another reason why data can be manipulated with, or tainted easily.
		- A survey is designed, consciously or unconsciously, to yield certain desired responses, and this definitely manipulates responses by providing narrow options.
	6. Things(time, culture) Change
	7. Assumed Cause & Effect
	8. Number and Percentage Assumption
	9. Vague Language
