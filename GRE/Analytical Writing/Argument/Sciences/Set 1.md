1. The following appeared as part of a letter to the editor of a scientific journal. "A recent study of eighteen rhesus monkeys provides clues as to the effects of **birth order on an individual's levels of stimulation**. The study showed that in stimulating situations (such as an encounter with an unfamiliar monkey), firstborn infant monkeys **produce up to twice as much of the hormone cortisol**, which primes the body for increased activity levels, as do their younger siblings. Firstborn humans also produce relatively high levels of cortisol in stimulating situations (such as the return of a parent after an absence). The study also found that during pregnancy, first-time mother monkeys had higher levels of cortisol than did those who had had several offspring."

- Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative **explanations that could rival the proposed explanation** and explain how your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.
	1. Evaluate
		- Conclusion: From the experiment of the monkey, it explains how birth order have on a human's levels of stimulation.
		- Premise: monkeys and humans must be similar species from a variety of perspective.
	2. Brainstorm Assumptions
		1. The Illogical Analogy: firstborn infant monkeys produce up to twice as much of the hormone cortisol, so does human?
		2. The Necessity Assumption: hormone cortisol is the only primary factor which affect stimulation of a creature
		3. The Statistical Irrelevance: the observation about first-time mother monkeys' pregnancy does not manifest any relation with birth order.
		4. Data bias: the amount of hormone cortisol is determined only by the birth order?
	3. Outline
		1. Introduction: A experiment on rhesus monkeys shows the extent of stimulation is affected by their birth order.
		2. hormone cortisol is the key? Gender & Gene's effect?
		3. Is experiment on rhesus monkeys analogous to human's situation?
		4. Is levels of cortisol of first-time pregnant monkey correlated with the offspring.
