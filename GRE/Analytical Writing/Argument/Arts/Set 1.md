1. Woven baskets characterized by a particular distinctive pattern have previously been found only in the immediate vicinity of the prehistoric village of Palea and therefore were believed to have been made only by the Palean people. Recently, however, archaeologists discovered such a "Palean" basket in Lithos, an ancient village across the Brim River from Palea. The Brim River is very deep and broad, and so the ancient Paleans could have crossed it only by boat, and no Palean boats have been found. Thus **it follows that the so-called Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean.**

- Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.
	1. Evaluate the Argument
		- Conclusion: Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean
		- Premises:
			1. The same kind of basket not only exist in multiple places excluding Palea but manufactured and devised by local people rather than instructed or traded by Palean.
	2. Brainstorm Assumptions
		- The Necessity Assumption: Existence of a Palean in other region represent the same thing is produced by foreigners.
		- The Data Bias: Was the Brim River deep and broad at that time?
		- The Correlation â€“ Causation Confusion: The absence of any tangible traces of boats does not necessarily imply no boats. Is there any methods rather than boats to cross a huge river?
	3. Pick a Thesis: Author does not provide sufficient evidence to substantiate that the "Palean" basket found in Lithos cant be spread from Palea.
