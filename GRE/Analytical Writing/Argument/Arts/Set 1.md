1. Woven baskets characterized by a particular distinctive pattern have previously been found only in the immediate vicinity of the prehistoric village of Palea and therefore were believed to have been made only by the Palean people. Recently, however, archaeologists discovered such a "Palean" basket in Lithos, an ancient village across the Brim River from Palea. The Brim River is very deep and broad, and so the ancient Paleans could have crossed it only by boat, and no Palean boats have been found. Thus **it follows that the so-called Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean.**

- Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain **how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument**.
	1. Evaluate the Argument
		- Conclusion: Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean
		- Premises:
			1. The same kind of basket not only exist in multiple places excluding Palea but manufactured and devised by local people rather than instructed or traded by Palean.
	2. Brainstorm Assumptions
		- The Necessity Assumption: Existence of a Palean in other region represent the same thing is produced by foreigners.
		- The Data Bias: Was the Brim River deep and broad at that time?
		- The Correlation – Causation Confusion: The absence of any tangible traces of boats does not necessarily imply no boats. Is there any methods rather than boats to cross a huge river?
	3. Pick a Thesis: Author does not provide sufficient evidence to substantiate that the "Palean" basket found in Lithos cant be spread from Palea.
	4. Outline
		1. Regarding this issue, the author of the argument concludes that ______. [Evidence provided by author.] Nevertheless, this argument fails to be completely compelling as it stands, for it contains a series of unwarranted assumptions and due to the lack of necessary evidences.
		2. First of all, the author simply assumes that a same kind of article found outside of Palean means it must not be unique technique of Palea since it was never uncovered beyond the village. It is unreasonable because there is no verifiable evidence that points out the article can not be brought from the village. A single basket can be engendered by various reasons. (Trade, Interaction, or even accident that bring it cross the river). If considerable amount of baskets was found, the situation may be totally different.
		3. What is more, the argument claims that the river occluded the communication between Palea and Lithos. It suggest that the Brim River was an unsurmountable barrier that made the basket unique. In fact, there is any proof provided that the Brim River has been remaining the same size since the ancient - which exact timing is not provided by the author. According to typical activity of a river, the scope is extremely unstable - its size by seasons and even the position by natural river force.
		4. Finally, the argument concludes that the boat that cross the river did not exist since any debris of boat does not be found. As described at the precedent paragraph, the river could be too weak to use a boat or even did not exist at that time. Even if the river did be at the place, the boat were possible to be created by the material that had been eroded with the time.
		5. In summary, the argument is flawed and therefore unconvincing. To better evaluate the author’s conclusion, it is necessary to provide more convincing and unbiased evidences, reason more frigidly and rule out all other possible explanations. [Better Evidence].
