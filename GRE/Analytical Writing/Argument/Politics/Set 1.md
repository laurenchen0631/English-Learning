1. The following appeared as a letter to the editor from a Central Plaza store owner. "Over the past two years, the number of shoppers in Central Plaza has been steadily decreasing while the popularity of skateboarding has increased dramatically. Many Central Plaza store owners believe that the decrease in their business is due to the number of skateboard users in the plaza. There has also been a dramatic increase in the amount of litter and vandalism throughout the plaza. Thus, we recommend that the city prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza. If skateboarding is prohibited here, we predict that business in Central Plaza will return to its previously high levels."
- Write a response in which you discuss **what questions would need to be answered** in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted result. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.
	1. Evaluate the Argument
		- Conclusion: The increase in population of skateboarding, which bring greater litter than the past, lead to the decrease of costumers.
		- Premise: the skateboarding is the singular and the most significant reason for the condition.
	2. Brainstorm Assumptions
		- The Stereotypical Assumption: Because the destruction was brought by skateboarding, the recovery is reachable only by banning skateboarding activity.
		- The Data Bias: Although skateboarding is the main reason that shopkeepers in Central Plaza concluded, the tourist or shopper could not have the same thought.
		- The Statistical Irrelevance: Is increasing litter and vandalism really related to the growth of the number of skateboard users. Moreover, is the slack situation involved with the litter or skateboarding?

2. The following appeared in a letter from a homeowner to a friend. "Of the two leading real estate firms in our town — Adams Realty and Fitch Realty — Adams Realty is clearly superior. Adams has 40 real estate agents; in contrast, Fitch has 25, many of whom work only part-time. Moreover, Adams' revenue last year was twice as high as that of Fitch and included home sales that averaged $168,000, compared to Fitch's $144,000. Homes listed with Adams sell faster as well: ten years ago I listed my home with Fitch, and it took more than four months to sell; last year, when I sold another home, I listed it with Adams, and it took only one month. Thus, if you want to sell your home quickly and at a good price, you should use Adams Realty."
- Write a response in which you **examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions** of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.
	1. Evaluate the Argument
		- Conclusion: Adams Realty is a better real estate firms than Fitch Realty.
		- Premise: Most of point of Adams Realty must be better than of Fitch Realty.
	2. Brainstorm Assumptions
		- The Stereotypical Assumption: More agents means better service. What about qualification and efficiency?
		- The Illogical Analogy: While Fitch Realty earn less than Adams Realty last year, in terms of the number of employees and working hours, their revenue is actually close.
		- The data bias: Adams Realty is a better company main because they sell the homeowner's house quicker than the other. The evaluation is very subjective.
		- The Illogical Analogy: selling ten years ago is not analogous to of recent year.
