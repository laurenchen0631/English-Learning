1. Introduction (3~4)
	- Restate the author’s conclusion (his opinion) and identify it specifically as a conclusion.
		- *Regarding this issue, the author of the argument [concludes] ____*
		- In this argument, the author [maintains] that _____.
	- Summarize the facts or proposals the author provides that leads him to his conclusion–and identify them specially as evidence.
		- He presents evidence to suggest this is valid including _____
		- *To [justify/support] the [conclusion/predictions/inference], the [argument] points out _____, which may seem [reasonable/plausible/specious] at first glance.*
	- Your thesis (final sentence): state unequivocally that the argument is flawed. There is **no need to list your the specifics of your three examples** in your thesis
		- Though the underlying issue may have merit, because of a lack of relevant evidence, unaddressed assumptions, and vague terminology, the author’s argument is unsubstantiated and deeply flawed.
		- *Nevertheless, this argument fails to be completely compelling as it stands, for it contains a wide array of [unwarranted] assumptions, due to the lack of [impregnable/relevant/immaculate] [evidences/data/information/proofs].*
		- Stated in this way the argument fails to mention several key factors, on the basis of which it could be evaluated. The conclusion relies on assumptions, for which there is no clear evidence. Therefore, the argument is rather weak, unconvincing, and has several flaws
	
2. Assumption of lacking valid evidence
	- *First of all, the author simply [assumes/suggests/claims/declares/proclaims] that ___fallacy1___*
	- *This [statement/assertion/description/explanation/remark] is a stretch and not substantiated in any way, though this is not [entirely/completely/absolutely/utterly/thoroughtly] [impossible/preposterous/unattainable].*
	- While such a view is not entirely without merit, it still ___.
	- *It is much likely that ___reason1___*
	- *There are [numerous/innumerable/various/plentiful] examples _____. For instance, ___example1___.*
	- *In order to [strengthen/reinforce/heighten/toughen] this argument, the author should [provide/furnish/present] more credible [evidences] and have to rule out and account for these or other possible alternative explanations.*

3. Second Assumption's Problem
	- *What is more, the argument [claims] that ___fallacy2___; thus, it [suggests/propose/indicate/imply] that ______*
	- *Specifically, this is again a very weak and [unsupported/misleading] claim as the argument ___reason2___*
	- *In fact, ___example2___*
	- *If the argument provided evidence that _____, the argument could have been [strengthened] even further.*
	- If _____ had been shown ______, then the author would have sounded a bit more convincing.

4. Third Assumption's Problem 
	- *Finally, the argument concludes that ___fallacy3___*
	- *From this statement again, we are not informed any persuasive evidence that _____. Thus, it is justifiably reasonable to question the arguer's conclusion.*
	- *Without supporting evidence and examples _____, one is left with the impression that the claim is more of a wishful thinking rather than substantive evidence. As a result, this conclusion has no legs to stand on.*

4. (Support Argument)
	- *Finally, the argument [concludes/premises] that ___fallacy3___*
	- *Admittedly, this is true especially when it comes to ____specific condition____.*
	- *In addition, _____further support______*
	- *However, the [above/said] argument does not constitute a sufficient [support/backing] to claim that ___fallacy3___*
	- *Because ___reason3___, ____refutation___*

5. Conclusion (1~2)
	- Quickly restate your original thesis, that the argument has too many assumptions and flaws
		- *In summary, the argument is flawed and therefore unconvincing.*
		- To sum up, this argument is undoubtedly invalid as it seems, for the lack of compelling evidence and sound reasoning.
	- Point out that the author has more work to do.
		- *It could be considerably [strengthened/improved] if the author clearly mentioned all the relevant facts. In an attempt to assess the merits of a certain situation, it is essential to include more unbiased and convincing contributing factors.*
		- To better evaluate the author’s conclusion, it is necessary to provide more convincing and unbiased evidences, reason more frigidly and rule out all other possible explanations.

- Necessity Assumption (Lack of Evidence):
- Statistical Irrelevance or Data Biases:
	- *____Order___, the author provides no evidence that the survey is statistically reliable*
	- *Perhaps the survey’s sample is not sufficient in size or representative of the quality of _____*
	- *For that matter, this survey is not strong enough to establish causation between ___cause___ and ___result___*
	- *However, the other reasons of the survey which  ______*
	- *As a result, without the evidence that the survey is statistically reliable the author cannot justifiably draw any conclusion by relying on this survey。*
- Stereotypical Assumption (Guess):
- Illogical Analogy: 
- Causation Confusion

## Examples

1. The Illogical Analogy
	- Question
		The following appeared in the editorial section of a national news magazine:

		“The rating system for electronic games is similar to the movie rating system in that it provides consumers with a quick reference so that they can determine if the subject matter and contents are appropriate. This electronic game rating system is not working because it is self-regulated and the fines for violating the rating system are nominal. As a result an independent body should oversee the game industry and companies that knowingly violate the rating system should be prohibited from releasing a game for two years.”

		Discuss how well reasoned you find this argument. Point out flaws in the argument’s logic and analyze the argument’s underlying assumptions. In addition, evaluate how supporting evidence is used and what evidence might counter the argument’s conclusion. You may also discuss what additional evidence could be used to strengthen the argument or what changes would make the argument more logically sound.

	- Essay

		__The argument claims that__ the electronic games rating system, although similar to the movie rating system, is not working __because__ it is self-regulated and violation fines are nominal; __Hence__, the gaming rating system should be overseen by an independent body. __Stated in this way the argument fails to mention several key factors, on the basis of which it could be evaluated. The conclusion relies on assumptions, for which there is no clear evidence. Therefore, the argument is rather weak, unconvincing, and has several flaws.__

		__First, the argument readily assumes that__ because the electronic game rating system is self-regulated, it is not working well. __This statement is a stretch and not substantiated in any way.__ __There are numerous examples__ in other areas of business or commerce, where the entities are self-regulated and rather successful. __For instance__, FIA, the Formula1 racing organization is self-regulated. __Yet__, the sport is very popular and successful, drawing millions of spectators around the world each year. Tickets are rather expensive, races are shown on pay-per-view, and nearly all drivers are paid very well.

		__Another example is__ the paralleled movie rating system that the argument mentions. __The author fails to clarify__ whether it is working well, but it is clear that the movie rating system is pretty well received by people, who often base their decisions to go see a movie with kids or not on the movie rating. It has never been a case when someone would feel cheated by the movie rating and express disappointment afterwards. Since the movie rating system is also self-regulated, it follows that this regulatory method is working pretty well and it is not obvious how it can be the reason for the poor electronic game rating system. **The argument would have been much clearer if it explicitly gave examples of how the self-regulatory system led to bad ratings and customer dissatisfaction.**

		__Second, the argument claims that__ any violation fees for bad electronic game ratings are nominal. It thus suggests that this is yet another reason for the rating system not working. __This is again a very weak and unsupported claim as the argument does not demonstrate any correlation between the monetary amount of the fines and the quality of the electronic game rating system.__ __In fact__, the argument does not even draw a parallel with the mentioned movie rating system and its violation fines. If any such correlation had been shown for the movie rating system, which supposedly works well, then the author would have sounded a bit more convincing. In addition, if the argument provided evidence that low violation fines lead to electronic game manufacturers to ignore any regulations with respect to the game rating system, the argument could have been strengthened even further.

		__Finally, the argument concludes that__ an independent body should oversee the game industry and companies that violate the rating system, should be punished. __From this statement again, it is not at all clear__ how an independent regulatory body can do a better job than a self-regulated one. __Without supporting evidence and examples__ from other businesses where independent regulatory bodies have done a great job, __one is left with the impression that the claim is more of a wishful thinking rather than substantive evidence__. As a result, this conclusion has no legs to stand on.

		In summary, the argument is flawed and therefore unconvincing. It could be considerably strengthened if the author clearly mentioned all the relevant facts. In order to assess the merits of a certain situation, it is essential to have full knowledge of all contributing factors.
