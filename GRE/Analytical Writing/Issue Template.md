## General
-  The average AWA score of a GRE test taker worldwide is a mere 4.0
- The Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) portion of the GRE consists of two essays: **Analysis of an Issue** and **Analysis of an Argument**
- **The AWA only tests how well you can write an essay**, and hence measures only your writing abilities. **Contrary to popular opinion, the AWA does not analyze your thought process.** As long as your essay sounds logical, writing ability is all it measures. 
- The AWA score ranges between 0 and 6.0, with 0.5 point increments, with 6 being the highest score and 1, the lowest.
	- 6.0 Outstanding: 
		- Clearly identifies and analyzes the most important features of the argument **with deep insight**.
		- Develops **cogent** ideas, organizes them logically, and **connects them properly without sudden transitions**.
		- Supports the main points of the critique strongly.
		- Demonstrates superior control of the English language, including **diction, sentence formation, spelling, grammar and syntactic variety** used in standard written English.
		- Few to no flaws in the essay.
	- 5.0 Strong
		- Clearly identifies the important features of the argument and analyzes them **thoughtfully**.
		- Develops ideas **clearly**, and connects them logically, with appropriate transitions.
		- Gives a very sensible support to the main points of the critique.
		- Has **clear control of language**, including diction and syntactic variety
		- May have **minor flaws like spelling errors**, but **no major flaws.**
	- 4.0 – Adequate
		- **Capable of Identifying and analyzing** the main features of the argument.
		- Develops and organizes ideas satisfactorily, but some important connections and **transitions may be missing.**
		- **Supports the main points** of the critique.
		- Demonstrates sufficient control of language, but may **lack syntactic variety.**
		- May have many minor flaws or some major flaws.
	- 3.0 – Limited
		1. Does **not identify or analyze** many of the important features of the argument.
		1. Has **limited logical development** and no proper organization of ideas.
		1. Offers support of **little relevance and value for points** of the critique
		1. Uses **language imprecisely** and/or lacks sentence variety
		1. Contains occasional major errors or frequent minor errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics
- Evaluation:
	1. Two readers will read your Issue essay and assign it a deserving score and two different readers will read your Argument essay and assign it a score. 
	2. If the grades given by the two readers differ by more than a point, a third, highly experienced grader is brought in to resolve the discrepancy
	3. A final score is the average of the scores assigned by the two readers or the adjusted score assigned by the third reader.
	4. Your final AWA score will be the average of your scores on Issue and Argument essays
- Points:
	1. Clarity
		- the grader can spend a maximum of only two minutes per essay, and the grader should understand what you are trying to say, by reading once.
		- it is your duty to make sure your essays have clearly composed ideas.
		- Ask yourselves these two questions when you are writing the essays. **What are you trying to say? What’s your main point?**
			- Just like how you can easily solve a Reading Comprehension question, graders assessing your essay will also need to find answers to these exact same questions
	2. Structure
		- It is the second most important factor on your essays.
		- The way an article is formatted, has a massive impact upon its readability. Your essays should read like a story
		- **Every paragraph reads like a separate story**, and the essay graders can easily scan through your entire response easily.
		- The transitions are smooth, and there aren’t any sudden twists in your response
		- The general structure is to start with an introductory paragraph followed by 3-4 body paragraphs and finish off with a conclusion paragraph. 
	3. Sentence Variety
		- You should ideally **avoid writing similar or same sentences**. No good writer under the sun writes two exactly same sentences in a single essay or article
		- It simply means that you should **use a different variety of words** to mean the same thing.
			- For example For, ‘The most important virtue of a leader is a strong sense of ethics.’, you should rephrase like this: ‘A strong moral framework is paramount for any leader.’ Get the point?
		- Keep varying the sentence structures, flow and rhythm by **switching between short and long sentences**.
		- Make use of **transitional and signal words** to vary sentence openings and endings.
	4. ~~Vocabulary~~
		- **AWA only tests how logically you can deduce information** and write a reasonable critique about an issue or an argument made by someone else
		- It is **not needed that you use heavy vocabulary or GRE words.**
	5. Language and Grammar
		- Even though **the mistakes or errors** do not interfere with overall meaning and coherence, you should understand that the time you make your first error on the essay, the grader will notice it, and will be more conscious while reading the rest of the copy. 
		- The grader will be even more vigilant to see if there are any visible or obvious blunders that you have made, and this can have a negative impact on your AWA score. So, try and make sure your essay is as spotless as possible
		- Don’t be in a hurry to submit it off and skip to the next section.
	6. Reasoning
		- Always look to **include as many logically compelling reasons** as you can to support your stance.
		- One of the most important features about a compelling essay is its ability to **convince the reader by means of sound logical reasoning**. 
		- Ideally, you should be able to connect your ideas properly to the central theme or idea of the essay, and convince the reader to agree to your point of view. 
	7. Evidence
		- In order to make your essay sound reasonable and logically sound, you will obviously **need to provide sufficient evidences.**
		- Search for evidences, either direct or implied, and connect them with the essay. You **can even create some random examples and evidences,** as long as they fit the bill and don’t sound too random.
	8. Length
		- The essay graders are aware that you only get 30 minutes and you won’t be able to cover every possible argument, reason and rebuttal.
		- Most GRE test takers won’t be able to find time to cover everything they would like to cover on the test.
		- **ETS has not spoken out about the ideal length of an essay**, and there is no word on the word limit as such.
		- When closely observed, there is a significant increase in the number of words from a 5.0 graded essay and a 6.0 graded essay. **The reality is, longer essay is usually better.**  If you are a long-essay fan and insist to pen a high scoring AWA essay on the GRE, **you should write anywhere between 500-600 words.** 600 is an upper limit for word count. **If you go beyond 600 words, you can see how the scores go down**.
- Essay Topics
	- Each and every essay topic that shows up on the real test is already published on the official ETS website. **There are close to 200 topics in all** – far too many to practice responses in advance.
	- Most of the topics that show up on the GRE Essay section can be broadly grouped into five categories:
		1. Education
		2. Arts
		3. Government/Politics
		4. Philosophy
		5. Sciences and Technology
	-  How do I get ideas for the essay:
		1. A large number of issue and argument prompts on the official essay pool are hard to understand correctly. And when you don’t understand something, how can you write about that something?
		- You should **keep a few related examples for each one of the categories** as they will be handy and save you precious time on the test day.
		- the essay prompts are full of obscure vocabulary and hence are hard to comprehend. Thus, you should **give every essay a read through. While reading, you should also make note of all the unfamiliar words and later learn them.**
- Essay Grade Tools
	1. ETS Score It Now!: For a small amount of $13 dollars, the ETS Essay Grader will grade two of your essays. **No feedback.**
	2. Friends, Family, and Experts
		- Before you let your friends or family judge your essays, you should tell them beforehand that you only had 30 minutes to write your essay, and so they should not expect you to write an award-winning piece
	3. Self-Evaluation
		- Self-evaluation, though most of the time not recommended, can be a really useful option for you.
		- There are **hundreds of mock essays on the internet**, and with a simple google search, you can get access to various essays for the GRE. Also, **most mock essays usually have an explanation at the end**, which explain why they have been given their respective scores.
		- If you can compare your response with those on the internet, you can roughly estimate whether your answer is closer to the 4.0 or the 5.0 sample.
		-  If you can do this a lot of times, you will begin to see a definite pattern, which can help you estimate your average AWA score.
	4. Internet
		- There are many GRE forums like [Urch](https://www.urch.com/forums/gre/), [PaGaLGuY](), etc
	5. [GMATAWA.com](http://gmatawa.com)
		- It was developed to grade GMAT AWA essays, but rest assured, there’s not much difference between GMAT and GRE AWA essays.
		- The grading happens instantaneously, and as soon as you submit your essay, you will receive a composite AWA score, along with various metrics on which your essay has been graded.
		- Other than ETS Score It Now, this is probably the most accurate AWA rater you will see, and you can expect a similar AWA score on your exam as well
		- The website allows you to **grade only 10 essays per email address.**
