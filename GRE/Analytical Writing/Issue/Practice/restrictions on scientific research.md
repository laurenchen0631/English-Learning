Whem it comes to the existence of restrictions on scientific research and development, some people hold the opinion that scientific research should be regulated since they could become treacherous. While restrictions should be imposed, the restriction should be place on minialistic scope.

First of all, science need tremendous latitude to progress. Even if there is not any law that prevent the researchs, someone who opposes them could lead to the suspense of the whole research to placate the anger of the public. Further, advanced scientific breakthrough have usually been seemed as heretic. This was the main reason that the scientific development had been hampered for hundreds of years. For instance, during the Medievel Period, various epidemic raged through the whole Europe. During the diaster, numerous scientists attempted to find the cure for those diseases, but unfortunately, they were treated as the murder and the cause of the catastrop. The reason why governments put restrictions on some kind of scientific research concurrently reflect the sentment of the people of the world. More specifically, if some people are publicly against some scientific research, the government would become obliged to restrict the researchs to calm the disaffection down.

Secondly, during the development, science, generally, is impartial, say, nothing about rightfulness or incorrectness. More to say, the researches are based multitudal reasons, including the desire to cure people, the impetus to fulfill cursority or even the purpose of creating lethal weapon to kill the enemies. Undoubtedly, some intentions are detrimental to the whole society, but we can not conclude that their research and contribution are also negative. Taking the biochemical weapon for example, it, admittedly, killed tens of thousands of people during the war. Be that as it may, through the development, people became more cognizant the feature of microbe and virus. Without those radical purpose, the knowledge about them could be more juvenile than the the current one. Which is to say, science does not cause the mistakes, which was caused by the people who used whem wrongfully.

Finally, in spite of the impartiality of science, some researches should still be restricted by the govenments. It is especially undeniable when it comes to the research involve the experiment on the human. For instance, medical research largely require to experiment the actual effect on the human. If the government did not put any regulation on them, the researches themselves could lead to abundant death during the process; thus, the government should at least put minialistic law to modulate the noxious effect to the people.

In summary, scientific research should be minialistically restricted by others. For one, the scientific research could be largely affected by the opinion of the public and the whole society. For another, the science, whose rightfulness or incorrectness was hinged on the persons that utilize them, itself is netural.

## Review

*When* it comes to the existence of restrictions on scientific research and development, some people hold the opinion that scientific research should be regulated since they could become treacherous. While restrictions should be imposed, the restriction should be place on **minimal** scope.

First of all, science needs tremendous latitude to progress. Even if there is not any law that *prevents* the *researches*, someone who opposes them could lead to the suspense of the whole research to **placate** the anger of the public. *Furthermore*, advanced scientific breakthrough have usually been seemed as *heretical*. This was the main reason that the scientific development had been hampered for hundreds of years. For instance, during the *Medieval Ages* , various epidemic raged through the whole Europe. During the diaster, numerous scientists attempted to find the cure for those diseases, but unfortunately, they were treated as the murder and the cause of the catastrophe. The reason why governments put restrictions on some kind of scientific research concurrently reflect the *sentiment* of the people *or* the world. More specifically, if some people are publicly against some scientific *researches*, the government would become obliged to restrict the *researches* to calm the disaffection down.

Secondly, during the development, science, generally, is impartial, say, nothing about rightfulness or **incorrectness**. *Moreover*, the researches are based on *multitudinous* reasons, including the desire to cure people, the impetus to fulfill *curiosity* or even the purpose of creating lethal weapon to kill the enemies. Undoubtedly, some intentions are **detrimental to** the whole society, but we can not conclude that their research and contribution are also *adverse*. Taking the biochemical weapon for example, it, admittedly, killed tens of thousands of people during the wars. Be that as it may, through the development, people became more **cognizant of** the feature of microbe and virus. Without those radical purposes, the knowledge about them could be more juvenile than *of* the current. **That is to say**, science does not cause the *abuse*, which was brought about by the people who used them wrongfully.

Finally, in spite of the impartiality of science, some researches should still be restricted by the *governments*. It is especially undeniable when it comes to the research *involving* the experiment on human. For instance, medical research largely require to experiment the actual effect on the human. If the government did not put any regulation on them, the researches themselves could lead to abundant death during the process; thus, the government should at least enact law, to some extent, to modulate the noxious effect during the research. **However, once the government excessively inhibit the leeway to which organization operates their scientific researches, the researches will lose their resource to continue and then fail eventually.**

In summary, scientific research should **only** be *minimally* *restrained* by others. For one, the scientific research could be *broadly* affected by the opinion of the public and *of* the whole society. For another, the science, whose rightfulness or incorrectness was hinged on the persons that utilize them, itself is *neutral*.
