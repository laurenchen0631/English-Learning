When it comes to that the art is subordinate to the poeple's basic needs, such as food, clothes and housing, some people may hold the opinion that public resources partonzing art should be suspended when the basic requirement was not expected. In my opinion, while art could help people to relieve their anxiety during predicament, the function did not constitute a sufficient reason to continue art funding.

First of all, people can survive without art, but they can not sustain without foods. Art is a requirement beyond the basic needs of human beings, thus it is unnecessary when those fundamental needs can not be satisfied. If we continue supporting the development of art when suffering economical depression, most of people would pass away during the progess, and thus those arts would not be appreciated. In the other words, who will appraise those arts created during the period of the depression. Futhermore, once the funding for art was revoked, government could use the immediate resource, especially money, to rebuild their country. After the basic needs are satiated, people would have more leisure and leeway to appreciate arts, which make governemnt's funding for the arts more meaningful.

Admittedly, the art could function, at least for some people, as an entertainment or relief to placify their ansty during the dilemma - unmeeted basic requirements. However, those function have been replaced, for most of people living advanced country, by the other things, like cellphone, Internet and games. Imagining the daily schedule of your or your friends' life, most of us spend our time at work, going shopping, browsing Facebook and Instagram, and sleeping. More specifically, We seldom take our time going museums, which is a sign indicating that "pure" art plays secoond fiddle within our modern lives. Some people may argument that games or Facebook still need the work of artists, but, in terms of pure art - painting and scultpure, they could not modernly represent an significane any more.

Be that as it may, there are various funding, such as for poverty, for immigration or for students, that should be suspended more than for the arts. Every funding have its priority depending on the environment. Contingent on the culture of a nation, the art could be precedence over other subjects. Even if the veracity, if it is the most exigent situation in which people barely survive, the art funding is still less important than those baisc needs. Therefore, we still can dispense with art funding for improving the quality of the people's lives.

When it comes to that the art is subordinate to the *people*'s basic needs, such as food, clothes and housing, some people may hold the opinion that public resources **patronizing** art should be suspended when the basic requirement was not expected. In my opinion, while art could help people to relieve their anxiety during predicament, the function did not constitute a sufficient reason to continue art funding.

First of all, people can survive without art, but they can not sustain without foods. Art is a requirement beyond the basic needs of human beings, thus it is unnecessary when those fundamental needs can not be satisfied. If we continue supporting the development of art while suffering economical depression, most of people would **pass away** during the *progress*, and thus those arts would not be appreciated **since they do not have excessive effort**. In *~~the~~* other words, who will appraise those arts created during the period of the depression? Futhermore, once the funding for art was revoked, government could use the resources , especially money, *immediately* to rebuild their country. After the basic needs are satiated, people would have more leisure and leeway to appreciate arts, which make *government*'s funding for the arts more meaningful.

Admittedly, the art could function, at least for some people, as an entertainment or relief to *mitigate* their *antsy* during the dilemma led by *unsatisfied* basic requirements. However, those function have been replaced, for most of people living *in* advanced country, by the other things, like cellphone, Internet and games. Imagining the daily schedule of your or your friends' life, most of us spend our time at work, going shopping, browsing Facebook and Instagram, and sleeping. More specifically, We seldom take our time going museums, which is a sign indicating that "pure" art plays second fiddle within our modern lives. Some people may *argue* that games or *dramas* still *demand* the work of artists, but, in terms of pure art - painting and *sculpture*, they could not modernly represent a *significance* any more.

Be that as it may, there are various funding, such as for poverty, for immigration or for students, that should be suspended more than for the arts. Every funding have its priority depending on the environment. Contingent on the culture of a nation, the art could *have* precedence over other subjects. *Despite* the *verity*, if it is the most exigent situation in which people barely survive, the art funding is still less important than those *exigent* needs. Therefore, we still can dispense with art funding for improving the quality of the people's lives.

In summary, according to the *exigency* encountered by the public of a nation, funding for art could be disposed to supplant for additional resource to gratify the basic requirements for **subsistence**. For one, art is not the articles on which people depends to survive, and therefore, it can be exchanged for *provision* by which people could survive. On the other, compared to the past's environment, art become less necessary action during our modern life in which people cast their time in mobile phone and computers.
