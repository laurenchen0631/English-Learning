When it comes to the traditional education, some people consider that those rigid *instruments* eventually confine their imagination. While the formal education actually partial narrow the pathway of our mind, we can not deny that it create more routes for us to create rather than prisoning us in the defined path.

First of all, in the modern time, most of creations were created based on the achievement of the past people. Without their gradual *evolution*, people may be still living in an age that computers and mobiles would not exist at all. With the past formal education we incrementally create more refined artifacts and then more products are shaped on the basis of those ones. For instance, the computer is, undoubtedly, the most innovative creation since the **several decades of** years ago. The machine was derived from **the effort** of a series of scientists, including Allen Turing, *concentrating* on *building* the device. **Furthermore**, most of these scientists gained their *knowledge* from life at university - **Allen Turing, the father of modern computer science, studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, and then designed the first primitive computational machine during the Second World War.** Without their contribution, we would not get *a* such innovative creation that help us engender more creative objects. Therefore, formal education dis not confine our imagination, but instead it foster more creativity occurring in our modern *society*.

*In my opinion*, formal education should not be called *an* obstacle that precluding our creativity from going out of our imagination. More specifically, formal education should be a route or direction that leads us to the more capacious palace in which lots of ideas lives and are waiting for us to explore the potential. My personal experience is a compelling example. When I graduated from the high school, I was once hesitant to enroll university since I was always told that some *luminaries* establish *renowned* corporation such as Apple Inc or Microsoft without graduating from the university. **After graduating from the university, I totally alternated my outlook that formal education is just a line of ossified procedures. According to my observation in the university, the most of lectures actually encourage the student to envisage various situations and furnish illumination to resolve some dilemma rather than compel the students to act as the only answer stands. That is, formal education, at least, is not always handcuff that enforce students to observe the only path.**

Despite the fact that formal education, in part, set our mind free, sometimes the education actually confine our imagination. Without proper experience and confidence, we could intentionally, or inadvertently, follows the steps of our predecessors. There are numerous *examples* that indicating the failure in that they only utilize the past *knowledge* and popularity rather than creating something groundbreaking. However, those seemly hackneyed creation may *not* be totally odious since some of them, in fact, were more elaborate than their predecessors'. In other words, accompanied with *suitable* learning and other aspects of education, those people could still have opportunity to create *an* innovative *invention*, which means education sometimes *unfortunately* restrain our creativity, but, be that as it may, it can still **instigate** our imagination with appropriate adjustment.

It is not formal education that restrain our minds and spirits since some people, even though experienced years of formal education, still create innovative conception or *products*. And, more specifically, the education provides, say, direction for us to explore new possibilities which untangle our mind from tremendous complication in our modern *society*.
