When it comes to the fact that any work of art, such as literature and art, must be understandable for most people in order to gain respect, some people may agree that it is true since the works must be aprreciated to earn its merit. While opqaue works could be forsaked by virtue of its less popularity, some historic artwork still be presseved however its obfuscation for the people at that time.

First of all, some artworks are futuristic and seemingly heretical at the time. Numerous artists or writers always desire to crave out something that could be praised by the soceity. For some of them, they decide to create preeminent works that concord to the fad. On the other hand, some of them pine for the creation that never exist or is known by the society, and thus, those creation was deemed as uncanny and mysterious. There are abundant examples that could recount the work that was disregarded by their trend. For instance, Picaso's paintings are surreal and impervious for many people. Be that as it may, his artworks is still be well appreciated by the modern society, since it commence a new trend of abstraction. In other words, even if the artworks was opaque for the people at that time, it could create a cutting-edge trend for the world at future.

Secondly, if a creator have been renowned already, part of the work, despite the overdue complication, could stiil be preserved to be appraised after the death of the creator. Sometime, we can not easily distinguish the purpose of an art just by the juxposition with the other works made by the same artist. Although those paintings, compared to the others, lack understandability for most people, the people would still regard the kind of complicated works as having some merit since their creator had made tremendous famous works. Da Vince is the best compelling example for the perspective. Mona Lisa have been deemed as mysterious work, including the meaning of the smile and its relationship with Da Vince. It was still appreciated and construed by the modern people not matter how opqaue it was. Part of reason derived from the works created by Da Vince, such as The Last Supper, to credit his other artworks. 

In summary, we do not need to fully understand, immediately, a work of art to justify whether it had merit or not. For one, many artworks are created byeond its time and period for their distinction. On the other, even if we do not recognize the meaning of a painting, by the repution of its creator, people would still regard it as significant.

## Review

When it comes to the fact that any work of art, such as literature and art, must be understandable for most people in order to gain respect, some people may agree that it is true since the works must be *appreciated* to earn its merit. While *opaque* works could be *forsaken* by virtue of its less popularity, some historic artwork still be *preserved* however its obfuscation for the people at that time.

First of all, some artworks are futuristic and seemingly heretical at the time. Numerous artists or writers always desire to crave out something that could be praised by the *society*. For some of them, they decide to create preeminent works that concord to the fad. On the other hand, some of them pine for the creation that never exist or is known by the society, and thus, those creation was deemed as uncanny and mysterious. There are abundant examples that could recount the work that was disregarded by their trend. For instance, **Pablo Ruiz Picasso**'s paintings are surreal and *incomprehensible* for many people. Be that as it may, his artworks is still be well appreciated by the modern society, since it commence a new trend of abstraction. In other words, even if the artworks was arcane for the people at that time, it could create a cutting-edge trend for the world at future.

Secondly, if a creator have been renowned already, part of the work, despite the overdue complication, could still be preserved to be appraised after the death of the creator. Sometime, we can not easily distinguish the purpose of an art just by the *juxtaposition* with the other works made by the same artist. Although those paintings, compared to the others, lack understandability for most people, the people would still regard the kind of complicated works as having some merit since their creator had made tremendous famous works. **Leonardo da Vinci** is the best compelling example for the perspective. More specifically, Mona Lisa have been deemed as *a* mysterious work, including the meaning of the smile and its relationship with Da Vince. It was still appreciated and construed by the modern people not matter how vague it was. **Undoubtedly,** part of reason derived from the works created by Da Vince, such as The Last Supper **that utilized many advanced perspective to make the unprecedented masterpiece, to credit his other pieces.** **So, the comprehensibility was not only key to determine if the works have merits or not.**

**However, numberless work of art, indeed, are disdained and hence cannot withstand the time. It is unfortunate that innumerable are forgotten by the public just being that the work is not comprehensible to the most people. Therefore, we can say that, in part, if the those artworks suit the general trend of the public, those works will eventually have merit rather than nothing. Despite the understandability altering many things, is it still an art if it was created only for the public? In my opinion, art is something delicately forged, but the primitive reason of designing is pure impetus. Furthermore, we desire to create something depending on the context including adversity, glee, disaffection rage and so on. If creators generate their work only for the reputation and profit, the spirit of art would become dearth from them. Once the spirit was lost, do they still have merits?**

In summary, we do not need to fully understand, immediately, a work of art to justify whether it had merit or not. For one, many artworks are created *beyond* its time and period for their distinction. On the other, even if we do not recognize the meaning of a painting, by the reputation of its creator, people would still regard it as significant.
