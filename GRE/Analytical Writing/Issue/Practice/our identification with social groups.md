When it comes to the issue that social group make us cognizant of who we are, some people may hold the opinion that the natural feature of our personality matters more than the influence from the society. While some people may isolate themselve from the group - thus keep their primitive personality in part, most of us are still shaped by social groups to grow as who we are now.

First of all, people live in various groups. From the birth, we live with our parents and associates, like as friends or mother, brothers and sisters. Until our current age, we have experienced kindergarden, high school, and clubs that are rife with disparate people. Most of us do not like the feeling to be expeled from the group, and thereby we sooner or later adapt to those groups by learning their morals and standard. During the progress, we can not deny that our characterists are impacted, more or less, by those social groups. Taking myself as an example, I am introvert and did not inhabit to communicate with others, at least before the period of college. But, after the education of university and the experience of internship and having a girlfriend, I am thirsty for chatting with others, though they does not fully alter my personality to become a garrulous one. Still, those experience in the soical groups changed me a lot.

Secondly, nature can be influenced by the environment. Our personality is not an fixed sign of who we are; rather, it is an indicator denoting that where we are now. Even introspective parents can have a chirpy and talkative child. On the other words, if it is not something about gene, it must derive from our experience dealing with other people. Futhermore, there are some scientific experience proving that even the animal and insects, which have stronger tendency than the human being, can be influenced by the environement. Some savage animals become mild after they are domesticated in the group of mellow society. Despite the difference between human and animal, it is hugely possible that our trait and predisposition would be shaped by the society within our lives.

Be that as it may, some people naturaly hate to intercourse with other people. For the kind of people, the impact of social groups are relatively limited, compared to the people who avid to play with others. Those people, since they spend most of their time with no one else, maintain their insignia that barely have flux during their lives. However, how do we know that their human-hating tendency are not caused by their early experience. Although they do not like it, they still have abundant chances to deal with others, including the docters after the birth and their parents or caretakers. We can not exclude the possibilities that that their identification solidify during their earliest experience.

In summary, the socials group more or less mold the personality that we currently have. For one, people ineluctably live with other groups from birth, which impact us unconsciously. For the other, natural characteristic can be changed, which is true even for unintelligent insects and sagacious animals.

## Review

When it comes to the issue that social group *makes* us cognizant of who we are, some people may hold the opinion that the natural feature of our personality matters more than the influence from the society. While some people may isolate *themselves* from the group - thus keep their primitive personality in part, most of us are still shaped by social groups to grow as who we *currently* are.

First of all, people live *with* various groups. From the birth, we live with our parents and associates, *such* as friends *of* *the* mother, brothers and sisters. Until our current age, we have experienced *kindergarten*, high school, and clubs that are rife with disparate people. Most of us do not like the feeling to be *expelled* from the group, and thereby we sooner or later adapt to those groups by learning their morals and *standards*. During the progress, we can not deny that our *characteristics* are *transformed*, more or less, by those social groups. Taking myself as an example, I am introvert and did not **habituate to communication** with others, at least before the period of college. But, after the education of university and the experience of internship and having a girlfriend, I am thirsty, occasionally, for chatting with others, though they does not fully alter my personality to become a garrulous one. Still, those experience in the *social* groups changed me a lot.

Secondly, nature can be influenced by the environment. Our personality is not an fixed sign of who we are; rather, it is an indicator denoting that where we are now. Even introspective parents can have a chirpy and talkative child. On the other words, if it is not something about gene, it must derive from our experience dealing with other people. Futhermore, there are some scientific experience proving that even the animal and insects, which have stronger *entrenched* tendency than the human being does, can be influenced by the *milieu*. Some savage animals become mild after they are domesticated in the group of mellow society. Despite the difference between human and animal, it is hugely possible that our trait and predisposition would be shaped by the society within our lives.

Be that as it may, some people **instinctively** hate to **associate** with *others*. For the kind of people, the impact of social groups are relatively limited, compared to the people who avid to *commune* with others. Those people, since they spend most of their time with no one else, maintain their *flag* that barely *has* flux during their lives. However, how do we know that their human-hating tendency are not caused by their early experience. Although they do not like it, they still have abundant chances to **get along** others, including the doctors after the birth and their parents or *nannies*. We can not exclude the possibilities that that their identification solidify during their earliest experience. Thus, even for the specific people, to some extent, social groups may have some influence.

In summary, the socials group more or less *molds* the personality that we currently have. For one, people ineluctably live with other groups from birth, which impact us unconsciously. For the other, natural characteristic can be changed, which is true even for unintelligent insects or sagacious animals.
