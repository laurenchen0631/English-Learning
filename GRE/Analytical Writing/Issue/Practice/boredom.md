When it comes to why some people feel bored, somoe people may hold the opinoin that it should be deemed as embarrassed rather than smug since the boredom was caused by the lack of creativity and self-motivation. While, at least for some situation, people feel boring when they satisfy their current environment and thus become stagant, we should treat all people who sense boredom in their life as embarrassed or despicable.

First of all, some people feel borded since they have been consummate at a specific area. Addmittedly, is is hard to achieve for most of us, but we should not regard those who are preeminent within an particular field languid because of their effort to summit. We can not seem those people as self-satisfied, since they acquired the title by their struggle, and embarrassed, since they use abundant self-motivation to obtain the honor. However, some people may question that they should still be seen as discomfited because they do not desire to progress or extend their advancement into next phase. Futhermore, they fit the condition of embarrassment by which those expert no longer have their previous imagination and motivation. Be that as it may, advance is hard to obtain for those who reach the peak about which they desired at past. If they just stultify for a moment to have a rest and look for new objective, they should not been seeemed as embarrassed.

Secondly, sometime people not overcome boredom just by the imagination and self-motivation. More specifically, the environemnt in which those people sustain play a more significant role in boredom. For exmaple, for the man who need to earn sufficient income to support his family and mortify the loan of the household, he must maintain a steady work that offer great salary. Even though he start to feel bored when working at the company, he could not easily alter his job if there is not an immediate position that provide better or equal revenue for him. For the kind of people, that we regard him as lacking of aspiration is not quite fit his condition since the thought disregard his effort to maintain his life and thus have a better opportunity to chase his next dream. 

In summary, even though boredom could be expressed with a sense of self-satisfaction or embarrassment, we can not easily comprehend all people with boredom in both categories. For one, some people are actually proificent in some areas and they may need to enough time to seek out their pending target. For the other, sometime boredom can not be conquered by the effort or imagination or a person since the environment also bring considerly influence on obstructing people's motivation.

When it comes to **the reason** why some people feel bored, some people may hold the opinion that it should be deemed as embarrassed rather than smug since the boredom was caused by the lack of creativity and self-motivation. While, at least for some *situations*, people feel boring when they **become satisfied with** their current environment and thus become *stagnant*, we should not treat all people who sense boredom in their life as embarrassed or despicable.

First of all, some people feel *bored* since they have been consummate at a specific area. *Admittedly*, is is hard to achieve for most of us, but we should not regard those who are preeminent within an particular field languid because of their effort to summit. We can not seem those people as self-satisfied, since they acquired the title by their struggle, and embarrassed, since they use abundant self-motivation to obtain the honor. However, some people may question that they should still be seen as discomfited because they do not desire to progress or extend their advancement into next phase. Futhermore, they fit the condition of embarrassment **for which** those *experts* no longer have their previous imagination and motivation. Be that as it may, advance is hard to obtain for those who reach the peak about which they desired at past. If they just stultify for a moment to have a rest and look for new objective, they should not been seemed as embarrassed. **In other words, we should not neglect the endeavor for which they have spent most of their lives.**

Secondly, *sometimes* people is not able to overcome boredom just by the imagination and self-motivation. More specifically, the environment in which those people sustain play a more significant role in boredom. For example, for the man who *needs* to earn sufficient income to support his family and **amortize** the loan of the household, he must maintain a steady work that offer great salary. Even though he start to feel bored when working at the company, he could not easily alter his job if there is not an immediate position that provide better or equal revenue for him. For the kind of people, that we regard him as lacking of aspiration is not quite fit his condition since the thought disregard his effort to maintain his life and thus have a better opportunity to chase his next dream. 

**Despite the justifiable reason that boredom does not universally contribute to platitude and self-restraint, the boredom of some people, undoubtedly, can been deemed as the sign of dearth of self-motivation. If one person just complain his or her triteness repeatedly for decades of years, we still can view the inaction as embarrassment. If we want utilize our, even minute, creativity to change the current quandary, we have many things that could be done to palliate our boredom. For example, if I am an lower-ranked employee whose main responsibility is to type various documents for the company, I would try many different ways to delve into the efficiency of typing, such as use of different software, create new macro of office softwares, or trying other suitable typing gesture. Moreover, I would contact with other employees to realize how could I help them, and so on. In short, to wield our imagination indeed mollify such embarrassment, but however, disparate people have dissimilar circumstances which make their boredom not mortified or self-satisfied.**

In summary, even though boredom could be expressed with a sense of self-satisfaction or embarrassment, we can not easily comprehend all people with boredom within both categories. For one, some people are actually *proficient* in some areas and they may need to enough time to seek out their pending target. For the other, *sometimes* boredom can not be conquered by the effort or imagination or a person since the environment also bring *considerable* influence on obstructing people's motivation. **If we still see those people as embarrassed, we, to some extend, scorn their efforts for preserving their lives or for achieving the climax.**
