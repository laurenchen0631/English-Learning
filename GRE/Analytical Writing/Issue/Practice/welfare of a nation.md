Futhermore, general welfare of a country could be largely disturbed during the tenure of an *awful* ruler.

Moreover, the general welfare of a nation is not based on nothing. In other words, the *sturdy* **economical** foundation of a nation determines **whether the welfare could last several decades rather than only a few months**. **The general welfare mostly consists of visible or easily tangible merits, such as unemployment benefits, public amenities and maternity pension.** **The popularity of scientist and artist largely decide the economical and technical position that indicate a nation's capability for future.** Thus, we cannot ignore the significance of scientist and artist in a country as a factor judging the achievement of a nation. More specifically, a nation must have enough *capital* to *uphold* *the* security and *affluence* of its people.

For deciding the achievement of a nation, its ruler and its fundamental ability of keeping its development that helps to maintain the people's welfare, most of time, are more important than current level of the people's welfare.
