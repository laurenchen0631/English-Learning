When it comes to whether the public have the right to be fully informed about all the information, some people may think that they should have proper right to obtain necessary information from the political leaders. While some information should not be withold within the the hand of those leaders, it is also veracious that not all the information could be told to the public.

First of all, people do not have the absolute right to know everything. Information could been deemed as a weapon in the modern society to acquire tremendous advantage. Furthermore, if the sensitive information were propaganded to all people, it would eventually cause disaster for the whole society. For instance, if we say that the people should be informed anything they desire to know, we must tell them everything including how the security system of protecting presidents works, what is time schedule of a police station, or the how the government encrypt their data. Once the information is open to the public, there must be some criminals that eager to use its information to attack the whole political system. In other words, the political leaders actually do not have responsibility to divulge all information to the public.

Secondly, even if the political have obtained the intelligence that is crucial to inform the public, they still should not have the public acquire it. Because some inforamtion is false or fabricated by intentional purpose to compromise the working of the government, without withdrawing the leak of the information, the whole system could be spoiled or suspended. There are numerous examples that show the story of the false information targeting the government. For example, there was a hack who steal the twitter account of NRP and he announced the information about the done assassionation of the president. Therefore, suddenly every television programs began to report the news and numberless stock plummeted. In other words, the garbled, false information could cause the country to suffer huge loss; thus, the political leaders sometimes are required to withold the information to prevent the further damage to the country.

In summary, the political have the right to prevent information from the public. For one, not every information could be pronounced to the public, especially when it comes to sensitive inforamtion. And for the other, numberous fabricated information could be circulated within a day, and thus, the politcal should investigate the veracity of them before publizing the information.

When it comes to whether the public have the right to be fully informed about all the information, some people may think that they should have proper right to obtain necessary information from the political leaders. While some information should not be *withheld* within the the hand of those leaders, it is also veracious that not all the information could be told to the public.

First of all, people do not have the absolute right to know everything. Information could been deemed as a weapon in the modern society to acquire tremendous advantage. Furthermore, if the sensitive information were *promulgated* to all people, it would eventually cause disaster for the whole society. For instance, if we say that the people should be informed anything they desire to know, we must tell them everything including how the security system of protecting presidents works, what is time schedule of a police station, or even *~~how~~* the government encrypt their data. Once the information is open to the public, there must be some criminals that eager to use its information to attack the whole political system. In other words, the political leaders actually do not have responsibility to divulge all *facts* to the public.

Secondly, even if the political have obtained the intelligence that is crucial to inform the public, they still should not have the public acquire it **without enough credibility**. Because some *information* is false or fabricated by intentional purpose to compromise the working of the government **or profit its creator**, without withdrawing the leak of the information, the whole system could be spoiled or suspended. There are numerous examples that show the story of the false information targeting the government. For example, there was a hack who *stole* the twitter account of *NPR* and he announced the information about the *finished* *assassination* of the president. Therefore, suddenly every television programs began to report the news and numberless stock plummeted. In other words, the garbled, false information could cause the country to suffer huge loss; thus, the political leaders *~~sometimes~~* are required to *withhold* the information to prevent the further damage to the country.

**Although the political leader have the said, justified argument to hide some information from the public, they also does not have the utter right to disguise all information from the public. In terms of urgent information, the government is obliged to unerringly and objectively publish the *information*. The epidemic, like COVID-19, is the kind of urgent information that should make the public cognizant as soon as the validity was verified. For example, in effort to protect its economy, Japanese government eschew the liability to announce the urgency of the virus. It is the case that precaution is more important than the consequence. Be that as it may, the *information* still should be reported without overstating and misinforming.**

In summary, the political have the right to prevent information from the public. For one, not every information could be pronounced to the public, especially when it comes to sensitive *information*. And for the other, *plentiful* fabricated information could be circulated within a day, and thus, the *political* should investigate the veracity of them before *publicizing* the information.
