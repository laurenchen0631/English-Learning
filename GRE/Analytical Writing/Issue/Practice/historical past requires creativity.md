When it comes to the pursuit to the historical truth, some people may hold the opinion that the creativity is necessary being that we only realize the past from the limited facts and evidences. In my opinion, it is true that we need to apply our imagination to reconstrcut the context of the past society since we do not have any direct contact with the past culture.

First of all, various region and ethnicity have tremendously different cultural habit and background. Most of time, we investigate history of a certain region by excavating those artifacts used the people at the period. However, to conclude the scenario of the period only according to the objects is a misleading way in which we ignore that the region may have intense communication with other cultures which mix their belongings together. For example, there are two different area - from one of them numberous delicate artifacts werer discovered, and on the other hand, from the other, various items which includes naive ones and complicated ones are unearthed from the region. More importantly, we can not clearly know that where is the boundary of the two cultures, not not mention that the existance of two different cultures were on the basis of our asuumpation that different kinds of artifacts denotes the difference of the culture. Without further documentation, the lifves of the two region totally are shaped depending on our creativity and specious assumptions.

What is more, even numberous evidence was found from a place, we still do not have the sufficient support to proclaim that those evidence are veracious even thought those proofs clearly points out the consistent scene of the culture. Sometimes, fake ones could be adulmberated into the real ones. Specifically, even if some artifact was created to fulfuil their expectation or thristy for creation that had not existed in the culture, we could inadvertently subsume those discoverd items as truth. For example, in the modern society, numberless writers fabricats plentiful fiction novels to satisify the desire to shift away from the real life. By the same token, the past people did the same things. However, we can not directly distinguish the fake part from the real part. Exaggerated as far as it can be, we have not evidence that the Greek Gods did not exist in the past since they could be extinguished at a diaster and unfortunately did leave any trace, which cause the modern people suggest that the uncanny story at the past Greek was just a mythology.

In summary, we can not preclude creativity from our methods to reconstrcut the historical period. For one, we could not find all evidences that clearly substanitate the every details of the culture. For the other, we do not have absolute discernment to differentiate the garbled evidences from the genuine ones.

## Review
When it comes to the pursuit to the historical truth, some people may hold the opinion that the creativity is necessary being that we only realize the past from the limited facts and evidences. In my opinion, it is true that we need to apply our imagination to *reconstruct* the context of the *ancient* society since we do not have any direct contact with the past culture.

First of all, various *regions* and ethnicity *lead to* tremendously *divergent* cultural *habits* and background. Most of time, we investigate history of a certain region by excavating those artifacts used the people at the period. However, to conclude the scenario of the period only according to the objects is a misleading way in which we ignore that the region may have intense communication with other cultures which mix their belongings together. For example, there are two different area - from one of them *numerous* delicate artifacts were discovered, and on the other hand, from the other, various items which includes naive ones and complicated ones *were* unearthed from the region. More importantly, we can not clearly know that where is the boundary of the two cultures, not not mention that the *existence* of two different cultures were on the basis of our *assumption* that different kinds of artifacts denotes the difference of the culture. Without further documentation, the *lives* of the two region totally are shaped depending on our creativity and specious assumptions.

What is more, even *numerous* evidence was found from a place, we still do not have the sufficient support to proclaim that those evidence are veracious even *though* those proofs clearly points out the consistent *features* of *a* culture. Sometimes, fake ones could be *adulterated* into the real ones. Specifically, even if some artifact was created to *fulfill* their expectation or *thirsty* for creation that had not existed in the culture, we could inadvertently *subsumed* those *discovered* items as truth. For example, in the modern society, numberless writers *fabricates* plentiful fiction novels to *satisfy* the desire to shift away from the real life. By the same token, the past people did the same things. However, we can not directly distinguish the fake part from the real part. Exaggerated as far as it can be, we have **no** evidence that the Greek Gods did not exist in the past since they could be extinguished at a diaster and unfortunately did **not** leave any trace, which cause the modern people *to* suggest that the uncanny story at the past Greek was just a mythology.

**Be that as it may, excessive imagination may obstruct us from *accepting* the correct evidences. If we hold pertinacious assumption that our imagination must be the truth, we will decline the evidences that seemingly oppose to ours since we want to preclude those fabricated ones. Although we should be aware of the verity of a specific evidence, we can not tend to treat all *antagonistic* facts as illusory. On the *other* words, we must comprehend various facts that could conflict each other and factor out those ones lacking enough backing to *verify* it. However, when we decide which evidences lacks conformity with the others, our imagination still plays an significant role on it.**

In summary, we can not preclude creativity from our methods to *reconstruct* the historical period. For one, we could not find all evidences that clearly *substantiate* the every details of the culture. For the other, we do not have absolute **discernment** to differentiate the garbled evidences from the genuine ones.
