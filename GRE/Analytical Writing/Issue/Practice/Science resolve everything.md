While science and technology go further than the past of thousands of years of human history, they still have corresponding limitation by which they could not solve infinite problems surging from the huma society.

Viewed from the chronicle of human, life of human always effect various coundrums. Some problems, undobutedly, are untangled by the technology, such as complicated building by progress of artitecture and physics or abundnt compuations by artificial intelligence and modern devices. However, these new invention, unfortunately, generate ramified dilemma. By the same example, nevertheless people can build more and more grandeous building faster and robuster than of the ancient time, our land is quite limited - more specifically, it is shrinking because of global warming leading more land submerged into the ocean. After overcoming the the problem of finite area of land, human are asked uneluctably to face directly the contamination. At this time, human will be stuck at the loop in which human create new technology and use groundbreaking science knowledge, and then some day the useable material would be depleted since there is no any resource without cost.

Futhermore, the time between corresponding technology adapting and the problem occuring usually takes several years. Taking the modernly exiguous diaster, global warming, for exmaple, we are currently confronting this dire problem which is due to the rapid growth of industrial technology. Are you willing to wait for someone to devise some miracle science that could spend five years to complete, or to stop utilizing the materials that are detriment to the environment. According to the current situation, most of government agreed to stop using those material in ten years, which is absolutely not an answer concluding by using technology or science.

When it comes to science and technology flourishing in the modern society, most of people would believe that they will eventually become the final key to conquer all problems that happen both in future and past. While science and technology go further than the past of thousands of years of human history, they still have corresponding limitation by which they could not solve infinite problems surging from the huma society.

Although technology and science can not resolve all problems, they are still the most reliable tools that boost the civilization of humanity. With them, human realize that many things happened in their lives are  not totally controlled by the capricious fate. Disease is not the  punishment that afflicit to mankind by the God. More specifically, technology and science efficiently resolve the problems that do not reach any  conclusion for prolonged years. To the contrary, those methods submitted to solve numerous nonscientific problems remain the same as hundreds of years ago. Most of problems have been already mentioned from the period of ancient Greek - what is love, what is happiness, how should deal with an ambivalent dilemma. Those kinds of philosophy without a doubt still play significant role in the modern society, but with modern knowledge that acquire express development we could eventually get a better solution than ever.

In summary, science and technology will not be the ultimate key to solve all problems in human society. While the science and technology are been developed fast than the past, there will be more issues birthed from the process and more importantly the new problem could be so serious that we have enough time to wait for another technology to solve the one.

## Review
When it comes to science and technology flourishing in the modern society, most of people would believe that *science and technology* will eventually become the final key to conquer all problems that happen both in future and past. While science and technology go further than the past of thousands of years of human history, they still have *insurmountable* limitation by which they could not solve infinite problems surging from the *human* society.

Viewed from the chronicle of human, life of human always *effects* various *conundrums*. Some problems, *undoubtedly*, are *able to be* untangled by technology, such as complicated building by *growing architecture* and physics or *heavy computation* by artificial intelligence and modern devices. However, these new *inventions*, unfortunately, generate derivative dilemma. By the same example, **~~nevertheless~~** people can build more and more *grandiose* building faster and *more robust* than of the ancient time, *but nevertheless* our land is quite limited - more specifically, it is shrinking because of global warming leading more land submerged into the ocean. After overcoming the the problem of finite area of land, human are asked *ineluctably* to face directly the contamination that are generated during the progress. At this time, human will be stuck at the loop in which human create new technology and use groundbreaking science knowledge, and then some day the useable material would be depleted. **Hence, they will experience the same course with identical denouement. In short, everything has a cost however science and technology advance**

Futhermore, the time between technology adapting and the problem *occurring* usually takes several years. *Maybe in the future, this window would diminish into only a few months or even a few days. Still, we may not always have sufficient time to wait a scientific solution without doing anything.* Taking the modernly *exigent* diaster, global warming, for *example*, we are currently confronting this dire problem which is due to the rapid growth of industrial technology. Are you willing to wait for someone to devise some *miraculous* science that could spend five years to complete, *in fact without supporting of the whole world it takes decades of years*, or to stop utilizing the materials that are *detrimental* to the environment *immediately*? According to the current situation, most of government agreed to stop using those material in ten years, which is absolutely not an answer *concluded* by *adopting* technology or science. In other words, *sometimes* we do not have spare time to wait for a suitable scientific answer happening.

Although technology and science can not resolve all problems, they are still the most reliable tools that boost the civilization of humanity. With them human realize that many things happened in their lives are not totally controlled by the *unpredictable* fate. Disease is not the punishment that *afflict mankind* by the capricious God. More specifically, technology and science efficiently resolve the problems that do not reach any conclusion for prolonged *period*. To the contrary, those methods submitted to solve numerous nonscientific problems remain the same as hundreds of years ago. Most of problems have been already mentioned *by the historic thinkers* of ancient Greek - what is love, what is happiness, *how do you deal with an ambivalent dilemma*. *Be that as it may,* those kinds of philosophy still play significant role in the modern society, but with modern knowledge that *gain* express development we could eventually get a better solution than ever.

In summary, science and technology will not, forever, be the ultimate key to solve all problems in human society. While the science and technology are been developed faster than the past, there will be more issues *brought about by* the process. *And more importantly,* the new problem could be so serious that we have enough time to wait for another technology to solve the one.
