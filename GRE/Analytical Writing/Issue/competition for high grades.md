When it comes to the competition for high grades at education, some people holds the opinion that the kind of competition eventually qualify the effect of learning. While, in part, negative competition seeking for the high grades hamper the effect of education, some competition still boost the effect of education further.

First of all, competition invokes the desire to be better. Without proper competition, the students can only rely on their ethusiasm to expertise a field. However, proper stimulation could lead to the students pine for understanding the questions that they can not solve before. Imaging a conditon that the whole class does not require any test or examination, all the students just listen the lecture of a professor. The students will not have any opportunity to verify whether their understandment has any stain on it until they graduate from the school and advance into the real society. Although those students who are avid to the specific field still could drill into the depth of field, those who aren't will lose pentitude of chance to approach the intriguing part of it. On the other words, competition for high grades encourage the students to have better understandment to those problems to which they may not feel interested before the struggle.

Secondly, positive competion provides the chance to help students to working closely. Undobutedly, some people may think that competition makes students isolated since they are opponents to each other; thus, they will not lose the contact with another students, causing the opportunity to learn from someone else. Be that as it may, the situation could become more serious in an environment of lacking competition. For example, if you met an abtruse problem that you could not understand by yourself, what would you do to solve the question? There are numerous answer including searhing it from the Internet, asking a professor for his opinion, relying on yourself, or seeking for the hand of those who have aleady known the answer. In my opinion, the compeition for high grades is the one among students, as enemies. More specifically, the compeition for high grades is the one with myself. To beat the past self, people have many methods to resovle the dilemma, but however, depending on oneself definitely not the best one.

In summary, the struggle for high grades does not absolutely weaken the the quality of learning. With the correct mindset, the competiton could thrust the people to deeply recognize the problems that they have not cognizant and the attitude consolidate the cooperation among the students.

To beat the past self, people have many methods to resolve the dilemma, but however, depending on oneself definitely not the most *efficient* one. 

**Despite the advantages of intense competition, the weakness could not be ignored, which is caused by the pure, negative competition. The competition solely for high points could cause people to use erroneous way in which they *completely* seek for the only correct answer rather than *thinking* about why the answer is the correct or better one. The kind of people restrict their envision in the scope of rightfulness, forsaking the chance to accelerate their ability. After their graduation from the school, they soon found out that the only correct answer does exist - answers are concluded by the process of *numberless* *attempts* and *from* experience. To some extent, the truth does not exist; on the other words, even the most *widespread* theories, such as *theory of relativity*, could be overthrown at a point of future. However, if the students are instructed with correct attitude towards competition, it is still a powerful tool to foster the learning at all levels of education.**

With the correct mindset, the competition could thrust the people to deeply recognize the problems that they have not been cognizant. Also, the attitude *consolidates* the cooperation among the students who helps each other to learn *more productively*.
