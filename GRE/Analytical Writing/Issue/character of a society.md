When its comes to investigation into the character of a society, some people may think that the hero or herorine chosen by the native exactly reflect the feature of a society. While those legendary stories including admiring hero and heroine sometimes, in part, denote the characterist of society, it could not be a distinct indicator to understand the character of a society.

First of all, those stories could be distorted or garbled to fulfuill the expectation of the people. A epic story must have well designed plot and roles to be conveyed through several centuries, and thus those heroes may not actually the personality of its inhabitants. There are numerous stories that could explain the tendency. Taking Greek Mythology for example, the mythic are rife with gods that disperse their pine and indulge themselves.

When its comes to investigation into the character of a society, some people may think that the hero or *heroine* chosen by the native exactly reflect the *features* of a society. While those legendary stories including admiring hero and heroine, in part, denote the *characteristic* of *the* society, it could not be a distinct indicator to understand that.

First of all, those stories could be distorted or garbled to *fulfill* the expectation of the people. *An* epic story must have well designed plot and roles to be conveyed through several centuries, and thus those heroes may not actually *be the same as* the personality of its inhabitants. There are numerous stories that could explain the tendency. Taking Greek Mythology for example, the mythic are rife with gods that disperse their pine and indulge themselves. It may actually represent a side of past Greek people, but however it is *erroneous* to remark that those people must have the absolute character implied in the mythology. *To the contrary*, due to the popularity of the mythology, some people began to pursue the character described in the story, instead of the fact the book portrayed the character of its people.

What is more, viewing through various epics of different countries, most of times, we could observe that those main characters have the duly similar traits, such as bravery, diligence or geniality. Despite some traits only occurring in particular stories in some country, it is still *weird* to say that the character of all society must be gallant and *accommodating*. For instance, *Norse Mythology* *underscores* the combativeness, and, on the other hand, Chinese legend also points out its people should be brave and sagacious. Based on the character in the stories, we can could conclude that the people of those two countries must have identical character. To justify a society, the hero or its role models can be just a part of evidence that describe their traits, but however, most of stories was fabricated and surreal to support its popularity.

**Be that as it may, the hero and its primitive role model, *undoubtedly*, represent the image of its society. In order to circulate a story, sometimes an elaborate arc and memorable character is not sufficient to *expatiate* its enduring *existence* through a society *for several decades of years*. Specifically, the reason of its circulation contributes to its precise reflection of its contemporary society and its instructive use for its people. However, we should not totally believe the veracity of a long-spread story. Moreover, to understand the character by those stories, we are required to investigate the real history, which may have various *perception* since the historians may have different perspectives, during the period of the hero.**

To sum up, a character deemed as a hero by its native people could be the basis to deduct the character of its people, but however most of legend of the hero could be garbled or *misrepresented*, and then left stories told to the next generation could be false. Therefore, to understand the character of a society by its hero may not be the best solution to observe the society.
