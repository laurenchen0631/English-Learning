By reviewing the past history of humans' life, it will be revealed that they have shown significant performance which has led to make some "impossible" situations to "possible" ones; moreover, human races has been always trying to use the previous experiences of their ancestors to achive progresses in "some" field of endeavor; in fact, the humanity has a kind of limitation in these experiences; hence, just can use of "some" of them not "all".

In the statement has been mentioned that it is "impossible" for the mankind gain improvement in "any field" of endeavor which is in a contradict with some fields of study; for instance, the areospace technology and knowledge almost a new technology which might have an age around fifty years. Before the first journey of human to the moon, there were not any previous achivement in this field and, even this technology would never come to the mind of our ancestors; but after that NASA could land its first spacecraft on the moon, the new science of areospace was established. Or as another example, the discovery of relativity ratio by Einestain almost sixty years ago, it was the first time that the knowledge of nuclear power was founded which before that period, a little number of people, just a few scientists including Einstain were involved in this field. In fact, in some fields of study that are known as contemporary sciences such as areospace and nuclear power, there is no previous achivement.

In addition, in the statement has been mentioned that in "all field" of endeavor, it is impossible that reach to achivement; however, as it was mentioned in the previous paragraph, just in few fields such as aerospace, nuclear power and Nano cannot use of previous achivements. On the contrary, there is a positive side that human could use of it such as airplains, trains, cars and etc. Wright's brothers were constructed the first type of plains which has no motor but, they could fly with it. After passing times, this invention was improved and progressed, but the fundamentals and basic rules are the same. This improvement has flourished as far as we perceive a vast type of plains; Airbusses, Jests, Booings and etc. are such these examples. In the case of trains, we also can see such this enhancement; improving from a simple steam train to a high speed and sophisticated train. Hence, humanity has been able to use of same achivements by previous people as an instructor and director.

As a summary, the humanity has shown that is capable to change "impossible" parts of the life to "possible" facets while there is no previous experience about it; on the other hand, he/she could utilize previous experience to progress some field of study.

**The author of the topic states an assertion that** it is impossible to make large and meaningful contributions to one's field of work without the prior existence of past successes. **While some may argue that** this statement holds true all the time, **others may counter that claim by** providing examples of individuals who made significant contributions to their field of work without prior success. In my essay, I will highlight both sides of the argument, and also provide a sound reasoning for my claims.

**On one hand**, the assertion seems probable. After all, the age old saying "practice makes perfect" is etched in our memories for a reason. There exists a concept in organizational and social psychology called "positive reinforcement", which refers to feelings of positivity and confidence that stem from prior positive actions. Positive reinforcement is a common determinant of employee and human motivation. For example, if you work as a software engineer and you successfully code 100 bits of data in under 5 minutes (an above average feat), then you would be "positively motivated" to continue coding even more. The same applies to other areas of life. if you look at sports (such as the Olympic games), our players are made to practice extremely hard before qualifying for the Olympics. This level of skill doesn't come without prior success on the field. Even in other areas such as the arts and sciences, one needs to achieve surmountable amount of success to catapult their career trajectory. It is for this reason that job promotions exist (to separate the "dooers" from the "sayers")

Another reason why past sucess might be a strong indicator of future success can be the fact that past success is mostly only obtained by a series of trials and errors. These experiences teach us the meaning of failure, and also teach us what our strengths and weaknesses are. It is only when we are more self aware that we can do our best in whatever we do.

However, it is also fair to say that while the above two reasons might hold true in most cases, one cannot assert that it is impossible to achieve career success without past achievement. Take a walk down memory lane and reflect on what great world leaders of the past have done. Legendary world icons like Mahatma Gandhi, Rosalie Parks and Martin Luther King (to name a few) did not have prior experience in leading a revolution. They did what their heart and mind was set out to do. They may have been powerful individuals, but they surely didn't achieve success by having prior experience in fighting for human rights. Similarly, in the performing arts, there is a term for people who achieve what is known as "overnight success". They are called "one hit wonders". A good example of this was teen sensation Rebecca Black, who uploaded a video of herself playing a song called "Friday" in 2009 that became an internet sensation. She had no experience in the music industry, but still managed to make an impact in it. JK Rowling is another fantastic example of someone who produced one of the greatest children's novels of the modern time, with no prior successful writing experience.

Thus, it can be said that while achieving success in one's field does add a lot of weight to one's credibility, it is not a prerequisite to success. Success is a combination of hard work, determination and luck. For some, luck plays in their favour better than others. For others, luck doesn't, and it is those people that aren't as lucky as others, who have to work harder, faster and better to get ahead in life.
