		- **not** only ... **but**
	- Weak Signal Words
		- and
		- in addition
		- similarly
		- **indeed**
		- also
		- **while**

- **Shift sentence** contains words that indicate that the elements of the sentence will be in contrast.
	- though, although
	- yet but
	- even (though)
	- in spite, despite
	- however, notwithstanding
	- ironically
	- **while**
	- Time shift: **once**, **at first**, **then ... now**, initially

- False Contrast
	- Not only watching for "no shift" words but also watching for absence of contrasting words.
	- For example:
		1. Though less celebrated, Haydn was far more _____ than Mozart: to Mozart's 41 symphonies, Haydan penned 106.
			- Always read entire sentence - not necessarily an exact opposite.
			- The blank does not have any relationship with "Though less celebrated".
		
- Choose answers that create the correct levels of similarity or contrast.

## Cause and Effect

## Elaboration Sentence
- Based on hyphen(-), colon(:), semi-colon(,)

## Apposition (同位語)
- Two words (usually adjective) follow one another.

## Double Blank
- Read the whole sentence.
- DO NOT assume a double blank will be easy just because the words seem easy.
- Focus on the words you understand best rather than on hard vocabulary that distracts you from the correct answer.
- Look for:
	1. Phrase or words that are superficially connected yo wrong answers.
	2. Answer choices that are similar to each other and almost fit.
