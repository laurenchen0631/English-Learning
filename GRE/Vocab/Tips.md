## (No) Shift sentence
- Non-shift sentence has no change in meaning or mood between one part of the sentence.
	- Strong Signal Words
		- because, as well
		- given that
		- moreover
		- just as ... so **too**
		- **not** only ... **but**
	- Weak Signal Words
		- and
		- in addition
		- similarly
		- **indeed**
		- also
		- **while**
	- Time non-shift: at the same time
- **Shift sentence** contains words that indicate that the elements of the sentence will be in contrast.
	- though, although
	- yet but
	- even (though)
	- in spite, despite
	- however, notwithstanding
	- ironically
	- **while**
	- Time shift: **once**, **at first**, **then ... now**, initially
	- Perception Shift
	- Special shift: **typically**, **Surprised**
- False Contrast
	- Not only watching for "no shift" words but also watching for absence of contrasting words.
	- For example:
		1. Though less celebrated, Haydn was far more _____ than Mozart: to Mozart's 41 symphonies, Haydan penned 106.
			- Always read entire sentence - not necessarily an exact opposite.
			- The blank does not have any relationship with "Though less celebrated".
- As a rule of thumb, **whenever "however" is immediately followed by a comma, it's a shifter.** If it is not immediately followed by a comma (as is the case here), and is rather part of a phrase, **it means "in whatever manner...."**
- Frequently, when "for" appears at the beginning of a sentence, it's setting up a contrast. 
- Choose answers that create the correct levels of similarity or contrast.

## Cause and Effect
- Cause: because, given that, since, as a result of, **for** ...
- Effect: therefore, consequently, thus...

## Elaboration Sentence
- Based on hyphen(-), colon(:), semi-colon(,)

## Apposition (同位語)
- Two words (usually adjective) follow one another.

## Special Phrase
- **anything but == except == not**
- **all but == almost**
- nothing but == only
- nothing more than == only
- by no means == not
- no less than == equal to == same as
- not so much A as B == B is more important or greater than thing A

## Double/Triple Blank
- Read the whole sentence.
- DO NOT assume a double blank will be easy just because the words seem easy.
- Focus on the words you understand best rather than on hard vocabulary that distracts you from the correct answer.
- Look for:
	1. Phrase or words that are superficially connected to wrong answers.
	2. Answer choices that are similar to each other and almost fit.
- Advanced Triple Blanks
	- Identify and "decode" the hardest word and phrases.
	- If possible, paraphrase all meaning before you fill in any blanks
	- **Read every word! Avoid skimming and scanning.**
	- Double-check the meaning again you fill in the blanks
