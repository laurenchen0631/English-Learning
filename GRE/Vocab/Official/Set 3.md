## Review
1. 这本书看似随意写的，会话式的风格掩盖了一个精巧的结构。
	4. mask表示前后逻辑相反，因此空格跟casually written, conversational style取反

5. 没什么比让非专业领域的人解决一个专业领域中存在已久的问题更让科学家愤怒了。如果你对这个观察持怀疑态度，想想当物理学家Luis Alvarez和地质学家Walter Alvarez提出恐龙是由于陨石撞击地球而灭亡的时候，古生物学家们很鄙视的反应。
	1. 文中無法直接判斷，必須從第三格的選項(輕視、無動於衷、虛偽)做推理，得知答案應該不是正面的態度

10. 新闻搭档中的每个人都是另外一个人的叫停者：如果另一个人对文章水平有疑虑则自己就不会发表。
	3. brake on和check on是主动的停止， impediment to是被动的，如果是impediment on就是可以选择的
