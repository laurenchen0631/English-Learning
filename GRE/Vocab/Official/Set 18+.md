## Review
1. 这部小说，尽管它带有多刺，流浪的幽默，但隐藏的远远超过它的传达，让沮丧的读者留下一种印象，即它的作者与这本书的异乎寻常的沉默中心人物的气质相似。

3. 哲学主张通常距离确定性一步之遥，但是对其确定性的企图是不合理的，这是一种残留的可疑观点，该观点认为哲学应该只处理必然和普遍真实的命题。

4. 在许多生态系统特征几乎没有变化的情况下，非本土物种可以经常替代原生物种的可能性是生态学家和保护生物学家们争论不休的一个尚未解决的话题。 人们可以引用非土着物种破坏生态系统的无数例子这一事实并不能真正证明所有这些新移民注定会产生这样的影响。 实际上，大多数存活下来的物种似乎对它们入侵的生态系统影响很小。

6. 纳米只是一个衡量单位，所以纳米科学存在于很多学科中。虽然纳米有广泛的应用，但纳米科学和技术还是被归为一个独立的学科，因为很多物体在纳米级的属性和在更大单位上的属性是不同的

10. 任何艺术形式的艺术家都没有与作品完全相同的生活; 但是，每个作品都告知对方，以及动态的阐明是传记作者的工作。
