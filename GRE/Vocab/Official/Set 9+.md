3. 关于恐龙灭绝原因这个问题，数年来一直有两个说法僵持不下，一个是因为小行星碰撞灭绝，另一个是因为火山喷发灭绝。因此，相关的矿床证据是不明确的这件事情变得越发的明显；即使持不同观点的科学家们态度都很坚定。
	1. 前面说两个研究是dueling,说明两个观点都无法让人做出明确的判断，符合这个逻辑方向的只有ambiguous
	2. even if前后取反，二空需要与ambiguous逻辑相反，只有decisive

4. 数百年来，作为医疗行业的执业准则的Hippocratic誓言和其他伦理规范都忽视了“讲述事实真相”这个概念。的确，Hippocratic誓言的其中一条准则——让病人远离伤害和不公正待遇——恰恰鼓励了其对立面，欺骗。

5. 因为这本书主要关心的是检验思考中经常发生的各种不足，比如过分欣赏无意的巧合或者是对伪科学轻信的接受，所以大部分的写作内容都有揭穿的本质。然而，它避免了对于许多这样的努力常见的斥责的语气。
	1. such as 后面举例的内容都表明第一空是负评价
