[Listened Article]
One of the topics most central to psycholinguistic research is the acquisition of language by children. The term "acquisition" is preferred to learning because many psycholinguists believe that no psychological theory of learning, as currently formulated, is capable of accounting for the process where by children in a relatively short time, come to achieve a fluent control of their native language.

Since the beginning of 1960s, research on language acquisition has been strongly influenced by Chomsky's theory of generative grammar, and the main problem to which it has addressed itself has been how it is possible for young children to infer the grammatical rules underlying the speech they heard and then to use these rules for the construction of alterances that they have never heard before. It is Chomsky's conviction, shared by a number of psycholinguists, that children are born with knowledge of formal principles that determine the grammatical structure of all languages. And, it is this innate knowledge that explains the success and speed of language acquisition. Others have argued that it is not grammatical competence as such that is innate but more general cognitive principles and the application of this to language utterance in particular situations, ultimately yields grammatical competence.

Many recent works have stressed that all children go through the same stages of language development, regardless of languages they are acquiring. It has been also asserted that the same basic semantic categories and grammatical function can be found in the earliest speech of children in a number of different languages operating in quite different culture in various parts of the world.
