She delighted in such indirections as ambiguities, incongruities, paradoxes, and puns. A method well described in her poems tell all the truth but tell a slant. Capitalization served her as a sort of underlining to emphasize any word she wished, for punturation she used dashes with such abandoned that her manuscripts have constantly frustrated their editors.
