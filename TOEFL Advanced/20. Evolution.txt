New biological concept and theory developed rapidly during the 18th and 19th centuries and challenged many old ideas. In 1859 Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution in a book entitled On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. The concept of natural selection and evolution revolutionized 19th-century thinking about the relationships between groups of plants and animals. His thoughtful presentation provided a sound biological explanation for the existence of multitudes of different organisms in the world and suggested that might be related to one another. To support his idea, Darwin used an example from geology - domestic animals, cultivated plants - and from his personal observations of a wealth of biological variability and similarity that can be found among living creatures. Although genetics and mechanisms of inheritance were unknown during Darwin's time, he noted that certain life forms are more likely to survive than others. This concept of natural selection provided, for the first time, a universal explanation for the variation of observed in nature. He made a powerful case that new species can be formed - and others become extinct - by a gradual process of change and adaption made possible by this natural variability. Darwin's ideas influence the field of biology more than any other concept.
