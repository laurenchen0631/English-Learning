The laser beams are special form of light. It is the latest an array of new energy sources, and scientists identify anamazing number of possibilities for it. The light way of laser beam are exactly in face with one another and so nearly parallel that they can travel for long distances and straight line. In comparison, beam of flashlight diffuses after only a few meters because the light ways are so many frequencies that they interfere with each other and become scattered. Laser may come to be used to transmit possess power that will not decrease even over a great distance. To do this, electric power will be translated into laser light and then the process will be reversed and receiving it. Laser can also be used as communication transmitters. A laser's ... measures in tenth million centimeters, compared to radio ways which span hundredth meters. Thus with laser, a large volume of messages could be carried on a very narrow band and frequencies.

The laser beam, a special form of light, is the latest in an array of new energy sources, and scientists are identifying an amazing number of possibilities for it. The light waves of lasers beams are exactly in phase with one another and so nearly parallel that they can travel for long distances in a straight line. In comparison, the beam of a flashlight diffuses after only a few meters because the light waves are of so many frequencies that they interfere with each other and become scattered. Lasers may come to be used to transmit pulses of power that would not decrease even over a great distance. To do this, electric power would be translated into laser light and then the process would be reversed at the receiving end. Lasers could also be used as communication transmitters. A laser's wavelength measures in the tenths of millionths of a centimeter, compared to radio waves which span hundreds of meters. Thus, with lasers, a large volume of messages could be carried on a very narrow band of frequencies.
