[Listened Article]
Mammals, like all other creatures, must either adapt their environment or perish. Adaptation occurs when an animal with trait suited to survival produces offspring. Conversely, a algorithm with disadvantageous or harmful trait will as a rule have fewer or no offspring. This is the basis of Dawen's theory about evolution. In his book, on the origin species which outline the theory, Dawen wrote, "the preservation of favorable individual differences in variation and distraction of those which are injurious I have called natural selection, or survival of the fittest." By fittest, Darwen did not mean the largest, smartest or strongest member of the group. Instead, he use the term to refer to those members of species produce the largest number of surviving offsprings. If species can not leave offsprings that can adapt to the environment, this species will sooner or later disappear.

Mammals, like all other creatures, must either adapt to the environment or perish. Adaption occurs when an animal with trait suited to survival produces offspring. Conversely, an organism with disadvantageous or harmful trait will, as a rule, have fewer or no offspring. This is the basis of Darwin's theory of evolution. In his book, On the Origin of Species, which outlines this theory, Darwin wrote: "The preservation of favorable individual differences and variations and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called natural selection, or the survival of the fittest." By "fittest", Darwin did not mean the largest, smartest, or strongest members of a group. Instead, he used the term to refer to those members of a species that produce the largest number of surviving offspring. If a species cannot leave offspring that can adapt to an environment, that species will sooner or later disappear.
