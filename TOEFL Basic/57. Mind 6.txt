[Listened Article]
Philosophers and scientist through the ages have compared human brain to various mechanisms - a clock, a telephone exchange, a computer. Certainly computer can work at amazing speed but its function is predictable and limited when compared to the brain. With 100 billion neurons and a huge number of connections, the brain is system loaded variables. No machine can process, store, and retrieve information as well as human brain, and no other mechanism has this capacity reacting so unpredictablely. France's Quirk who won Nobel Prize with his role in determining the structure of DNA molecure has compared the brain to the black box. Psychologist had studied extensively what is going into the box, experience, and what emerges behavior. Now, neurobiologists are examining interior of the box and had began describing some of brain's processes.

With 100 billion neurons and a huge number of connections, the brain is a system loaded with variables. No machine can process, store, and retrieve information as well as the human brain, and no other mechanism has the added capacity of reacting so unpredictably. Francis Crick, who won the Nobel Prize for his role in determining the structure of the DNA molecule., has compared the brain to a black box. Psychologists have studied extensively what goes into the box - experience, and what emerges, behavior. Now, neurobiologists are examining the interior of the black box and have begun describing some of the brain's processes.
