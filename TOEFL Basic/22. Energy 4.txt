In 1865, James Clark Maxwell rolled that there is eitherial medium filling space and permeating bodies capable of being setting motion and transmitting that motion from one part to another. And communicating that motion to growth matters so as to heat it and effect it in various ways. And explaining his electrinomic theory, Maxwell suggested that the existence of Ether enable light to be transmitted to space. It was popular concept until Albert Iintstace came along and disproved it. Iintstace once said "the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible," but actually no other individual has made world more difficult to understand. He postulated the time expand, the substance of the world explodes and vanishes, length contract and common sense no longer matters. From the time of Iintstace's first important publication in 1905 to the present, science has become the world's mathmeation.

In 1865 James Clerk Maxwell wrote that "there is an aethereal medium filling space and permeating bodies, capable of being set in motion and of transmitting that motion from one part to another, and communicating that motion to gross matter so as to heat to and affect it in various ways." In explaining his electromagnetic theory, Maxwell suggested that the existence of an "aether" enabled light to be transmitted through space. It was a popular concept - until Albert Einstein came along and disproved it. Einstein once said, "The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible," but actually no other individual has made the world more difficult to understand. He postulated that time expands, the substance of the world explodes and vanishes, lengths contract, and common sense no longer matters. From the time of Einstein's first important publication in 1905 to the present, science has become the world of the mathematician.

- ether == aether
- there is an aethereal medium filling space and permeating bodies, capable of being set in motion and of transmitting that motion from one part to another, and communicating that motion to gross matter so as to heat to and affect it in various ways. 有一種以太介質充滿在空間中，並且可以穿透物體，能以運動的形式出現，並能將這種運動從一個部分傳遞到另一個部分，還能將這種運動傳送給物質，以便加熱此物質，並透過多種方式影響它。
