A slice of bread represents centuries of evolution, staring with a single wild variety of wheat, which human adapted to their needs. Originating in the valley of the Tigris River, wheat cultivation spread along the lines of civilization. It first traveled to other parts of Asia Minor, then on to Egypt in the south and, centuries later, to Europe. As wheat cultivation spread, different climates and soils served to produce new varieties. Eventually this became a conscious process, with different strains of wheat being crossed to create entirely new kinds, combining the desirable characteristics of the parent strains. As a result of this process of diversification, there are now thousands of varieties of wheat being grown around the world.
