[Listened Article]
Gershwin was an undoubted genius that was writing show tune that everybody whistled and humed. They were original, fresh, clever, timely, and often quite beautiful, "Lady Be Good", "I Will Crash on You", "The Man I Love", "Someone to Watch Over Me", "Looking for A Boy", the list can go on and on. These tunes were not jazz, but ironically many quickly became jazz standards that is tuned jazzmen's love to play and improvise around.
Another irony of Gershwin's relationship with jazz is that he himself adored music. As a boy of eight, he were roller scare to harlane to 145 street, and sat on curf about site Beronde Welcome's club, and listened to the early jazz called rag time flowed out the door. His own piano playing had very jazz touch, angular, swift of be. But he couldn't write the stuff as bemused critics and public thought. He was just a great song writer, possibly the best that ever lived.
