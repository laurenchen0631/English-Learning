As the world's supply of fossil fuel is depleted, attention is turning to the greatest and most readily available source of power, the sun. The amount of the energy contained in the sunlight falls on the earth's surface g... is 15000 times as great as the amount of energy used annually by human beings. The sun's heat has long been used for evaporating salt and drying foods. Over the course of human history, however, the sun's energy has also been used for heating purposes. Sunlight have been exploited to heat homes, greenhouses and beds when other resources such as woods had been unavailable. Such uses of sunlight date back to 2500 years, to the world of the ancient Greeks and Romans whose building were designed to catch more sun in cooler months than in warmer ones, much like modern energy-efficient structures are today.
