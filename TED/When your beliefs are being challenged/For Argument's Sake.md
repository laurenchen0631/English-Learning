My name is Dan Cohen and I am an *academic*, as he said. And what that means is that I argue. It's an important part of my life. And I like to argue. And I'm not just an academic, I'm a philosopher, so I like to think that I'm actually pretty good at arguing.

But I also like to think a lot about arguing. And in thinking about arguing, I've come across some puzzles. And one of the puzzles is that, as I've been thinking about arguing over the years -- and it's been decades now -- I've gotten better at arguing. But the more that I argue and the better I get at arguing, the more that I lose. And that's a puzzle. 

And the other puzzle is that I'm actually okay with that. Why is it that I'm okay with losing and why is it that I think good arguers are actually better at losing? Well, there are some other puzzles. One is: why do we argue? Who benefits from arguments? When I think about arguments, I'm talking about -- let's call them *academic arguments* or **cognitive** arguments -- where something cognitive is **at stake**: Is this *proposition* true? Is this theory a good theory? Is this a **viable** interpretation of the data or the text? And so on. I'm not interested really in arguments about whose turn it is to do the dishes or who has to take out the garbage. Yeah, we have those arguments, too. I tend to win those arguments, because I know the tricks. But those aren't the important arguments. I'm interested in academic arguments, and here are the things that puzzle me. 
	- academic argument 學術辯論
	+ at stake 有風險/處於危急關頭 == If something that is valuable is at stake, it is in a situation where it might be lost.
		> Thousands of lives will be at stake if emergency aid does not arrive in the city soon.
	+ proposition
		> 主張/論點 |A statement or assertion that expresses a judgement or opinion.| the proposition that high taxation is undesirable
		> 命題 |A formal statement of a theorem or problem, typically including the demonstration.|
		> 提議/建議 |A suggested scheme or plan of action, especially in a business context.| a detailed investment proposition
		> 提議/建議 |Make an offer or suggestion to.| she had been propositioned at the party by a subeditor with bad breath
		> 法案/議案 |A constitutional proposal; a bill.| Californian voters rejected by a two-to-one majority proposition 128
		> 求歡 |An offer of sexual intercourse made to a person with whom one is not involved, especially one that is made in an unsubtle way.|
		> 求歡 |Make a suggestion of sexual intercourse to (someone), especially in an unsubtle way.|
		> 計畫/想法 |A project, task, idea, etc. considered in terms of its likely success or difficulty.| setting up your own business can seem an attractive proposition
	+ viable /ˈvʌɪəb(ə)l/ 可行的 == Capable of working successfully; feasible.

First, what do good arguers win when they win an argument? What do I win if I convince you that **utilitarianism** isn't really the right framework for thinking about **ethical** theories? What do we win when we win an argument? Even before that, what does it matter to me whether you have this idea that **Kant's** theory works or Mill is the right **ethicist** to follow? It's **no skin off my back** whether you think **functionalism** is a viable theory of mind. So why do we even try to argue? Why do we try to convince other people to believe things they don't want to believe, and is that even a nice thing to do? Is that a nice way to treat another human being, try and make them think something they don't want to think? Well, my answer is going to make reference to three models for arguments. 
	- utilitarianism /jʊˌtɪlɪˈtɛːrɪənɪz(ə)m/ 功利主義
	- ethical /ˈɛθɪk(ə)l/ 
	- ethicist /ˈɛθɪksɪst/ 倫理學家
	- no skin off my back == dont care == wont harm you a bit, 
	- functionalism 功能主義

The first model -- let's call it the **dialectical** model -- is we think of arguments as war; you know what that's like -- a lot of screaming and shouting and winning and losing. That's not a very helpful model for arguing, but it's a pretty common and **entrenched** model for arguing. 
	- dialectical /dʌɪəˈlɛktɪk(ə)l/ 
		> 辯證的 |Relating to the logical discussion of ideas and opinions.| dialectical ingenuity
		> 相反的 |Concerned with or acting through opposing forces.| a dialectical opposition between social convention and individual libertarianism

But there's a second model for arguing: arguments as proofs. Think of a mathematician's argument. Here's my argument. Does it work? Is it any good? Are the **premises** **warranted**? Are the **inferences** valid? Does the conclusion follow from the premises? No **opposition**, no **adversariality** -- not necessarily any arguing in the *adversarial* sense. 
	- adversariality 對立 == The condition of being adversarial.
	- adversarial /ˌadvəˈsɛːrɪəl/ 
		> 對立的 |Involving or characterized by conflict or opposition.| the adversarial nature of the two-party system
		> 對抗制的 |(of a trial or legal proceedings) in which the parties in a dispute have the responsibility for finding and presenting evidence.|

But there's a third model to keep in mind that I think is going to be very helpful, and that is arguments as performances, arguments in front of an audience. We can think of a politician trying to present a position, trying to convince the audience of something. 

But there's another twist on this model that I really think is important; namely, that when we argue before an audience, sometimes the audience has a more **participatory** role in the argument; that is, arguments are also performances in front of juries, who make a judgment and decide the case. Let's call this the **rhetorical** model, where you have to **tailor** your argument to the audience at hand. You know, presenting a sound, well-argued, tight argument in English before a *francophone* audience just isn't going to work. 
	- participatory /pɑːtɪsɪˈpeɪtəri/, /pɑːˈtɪsɪpətri/ 參與的 == Involving or characterized by participation.
	- rhetorical /rɪˈtɒrɪk(ə)l/ 
		> 修辭學的 |Relating to or concerned with the art of rhetoric.|
		> 雄辯的/浮誇的 |Expressed in terms intended to persuade or impress.|
		> 循序漸進的(問題) |(of a question) asked in order to produce an effect or to make a statement rather than to elicit information.|
	- tailor
		> 裁縫師 |A person whose occupation is making fitted clothes such as suits, trousers, and jackets to fit |
		> 扁鰺 |tailorfish; bluefish|
		> 裁製|(of a tailor) make (clothes) to fit individual customers.|
		> 修改/使合適 |Make or adapt for a particular purpose or person.|
	- francophone
		> 法語圈的 |speaking French as the main or official language|
		> 法語圈 |someone who speaks French as a first or main language:|

So we have these models -- argument as war, argument as proof and argument as performance. Of those three, the argument as war is the dominant one. It dominates how we talk about arguments, it dominates how we think about arguments, and because of that, it shapes how we argue, our actual conduct in arguments. Now, when we talk about arguments, we talk in a very **militaristic** language. We want strong arguments, arguments that have a lot of punch, arguments that are right on target. We want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order. We want killer arguments. That's the kind of argument we want. It is the dominant way of thinking about arguments. When I'm talking about arguments, that's 
probably what you thought of, the adversarial model. 
	- militaristic /ˌmɪlɪtəˈrɪstɪk/ 軍國主義的/強硬的 == Advocating or pursuing an aggressive military policy; hawkish.

But the war metaphor, the war **paradigm** or model for thinking about arguments, has, I think, *deforming* effects on how we argue. First, it elevates tactics over substance. You can take a class in logic, argumentation. You learn all about the **subterfuges** that people use to try and win arguments -- the false steps. It magnifies the *us-versus them* aspect of it. It makes it **adversarial**; it's **polarizing**. And the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph -- glorious triumph -- or abject, **ignominious** defeat. I think those are deforming effects, and worst of all, it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation or compromise or collaboration. 
	- deform (使)變形 == Become distorted or misshapen; undergo deformation.
	- paradigm /ˈparədʌɪm/ 
	- polarize /ˈpəʊlərʌɪz/ 
	- ignominious /ˌɪɡnəˈmɪnɪəs/ 丟臉的 == Deserving or causing public disgrace or shame.

Think about that one -- have you ever entered an argument thinking, "Let's see if we can *hash something out*, rather than fight it out. What can we work out together?" I think the argument-as-war metaphor inhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation. 
	? I think the argument-as-war metaphor inhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation. 
	- hash sth out 和其他人協商共同達成 == to talk about something with someone else in order to reach agreement about it
		> You two hash out the details of the presentation.
	- fight sth out 通過鬥爭使得到解決
		> I can't help them to resolve their quarrel -- they must fight it out between them. 

And finally -- this is really the worst thing -- arguments don't seem to get us anywhere; they're dead ends. They are like **roundabouts** or **traffic jams** or **gridlock** in conversation. We don't get anywhere. And one more thing. And as an educator, this is the one that really bothers me: If argument is war, then there's an implicit equation of learning with losing. 
	- roundabout
		> |A large revolving device in a playground, for children to ride on.|
		> 旋轉木馬 |A revolving machine with model horses or cars on which people ride for amusement; a merry-go-round.|
		> 繞道的 |Not following a short direct route; circuitous.| we need to take a roundabout route to throw off any pursuit
		> 繞圈子的 |Not saying what is meant clearly and directly; circumlocutory.| in a roundabout way, he was fishing for information
	- traffic jam 交通阻塞
	- gridlock
		> 極端嚴重的交通壅塞 |A situation of very severe traffic congestion.| the city reaches gridlock during peak hours
		> 僵局 |deadlock|

And let me explain what I mean. Suppose you and I have an argument. You believe a proposition, P, and I don't. And I say, "Well, why do you believe P?" And you give me your reasons. And I object and say, "Well, what about ...?" And you answer my objection. And I have a question: "Well, what do you mean? How does it apply over here?" And you answer my question. Now, suppose at the end of the day, I've objected, I've questioned, I've raised all sorts of counter counter-considerations and in every case you've responded to my satisfaction. And so at the end of the day, I say, "You know what? I guess you're right: P." So, I have a new belief. And it's not just any belief; it's **well-articulated**, examined -- it's a battle-tested belief. 

Great cognitive gain. OK, who won that argument? Well, the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won, even though I'm the only one who made any cognitive gain. What did you gain, cognitively, from convincing me? Sure, you got some pleasure out of it, maybe your **ego stroked**, maybe you get some professional status in the field -- "This guy's a good arguer." But just from a cognitive point of view, who was the winner? The war metaphor forces us into thinking that you're the winner and I lost, even though I gained. And there's something wrong with that picture. And that's the picture I really want to change if we can. 
	? the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won, even though I'm the only one who made any cognitive gain
	- ego stroke == when someone purposely fishes for compliments from other people to reassure themselves that they are in fact good looking and/or good at a certain subject.

So, how can we find ways to make arguments yield something positive? What we need is new **exit** strategies for arguments. But we're not going to have new exit strategies for arguments until we have new entry approaches to arguments. We need to think of new kinds of arguments. In order to do that, well -- I don't know how to do that. That's the bad news. The argument-as-war metaphor is just ... it's a monster. It's just taken up habitation in our mind, and there's no magic **bullet** that's going to kill it. There's no magic wand that's going to make it disappear. I don't have an answer. 
	- exit /ˈɛksɪt/, /ˈɛɡzɪt/ 
	- bullet /ˈbʊlɪt/ 

But I have some suggestions. Here's my suggestion: If we want to think of new kinds of arguments, what we need to do is think of new kinds of arguers. 

So try this: Think of all the roles that people play in arguments. There's the **proponent** and the opponent in an **adversarial**, **dialectical** argument. There's the audience in **rhetorical** arguments. There's the **reasoner** in arguments as proofs. All these **different roles**. Now, can you imagine an argument in which you are the arguer, but you're also in the audience, watching yourself argue? Can you imagine yourself watching yourself argue, losing the argument, and yet still, at the end of the argument, saying, "Wow, that was a good argument!" Can you do that? I think you can, and I think if you can imagine that kind of argument, where the loser says to the winner and the audience and the jury can say, "Yeah, that was a good argument," then you have imagined a good argument. And more than that, I think you've imagined a good arguer, an arguer that's worthy of the kind of arguer you should try to be. 
	- reasoner 推理者

Now, I lose a lot of arguments. It takes practice to become a good arguer, in the sense of being able to benefit from losing, but fortunately, I've had many, many colleagues who have been willing to *step up* and provide that practice for me. 
	- step up 在有需要（或有機會）時採取行動 = to take action when there is a need or opportunity for it
		> Investors have to step up and assume more responsibility for their assets.
		> I've had many, many colleagues who have been willing to step up and provide that practice for me.
