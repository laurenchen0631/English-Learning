With the skill being passed on from master to apprentice, engineering is regarded the trade rather than the profession up to the late 18th century. Then in 1794 the first school for engineers was established, ??? Technic in Paris. America's first engineering school, ???, was open 30 years later. Today, over 280 schools grant 65,000 engineering degrees in the United States alone. Schools, such as Misscuaute Institution Technology, are working to create a new type of engineer. Students there are receiving intensive trainings, scientific concept and practical applications. At the same time, they receive broad exposure to humanities by encouraging their students to develop aesthetic value and a sense of fun. Teachers at MIT believe these future engineers will be better prepared to deal with a vast array of problems of scientific faces.

With skills being passed on from master to apprentice, engineering was regarded as a trade rather than a profession up until the late 18th century. Then, in 1794, the first school for engineers was established, the Ecole Polytechnique, in Paris. America's first engineering school, the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, was opened 30 years later. Today, over 280 schools grant 65,000 engineering degrees in the United States alone. Schools such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology are working to create a new type of engineer. Students there receive intensive training in scientific concept and practical applications; at the same time, they receive broad exposure to the humanities.
