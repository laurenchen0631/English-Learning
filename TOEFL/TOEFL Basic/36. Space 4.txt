In the earliest days after the earth was formed, the atmosphere of the planet consist mainly of water, hydrogen, ?, and ?, a combination that would be deadly to most of modern forms of life. In fact, this very gas react with each other, prompted by lightning, altered by out light or some other form of energy to create chemical compound from which life ?? began. Scientists had conducted a experiment to recreate this process, by first producing a combination of gases similar to that ??? atmosphere billions of years ago and directing both of energy to simulate lightning to the mixture. Scientists had managed to create a chemical reaction which produce ? and other chemical compounds found on all known forms of life.

In the earliest days after the earth was formed, the atmosphere of the planet consisted mainly of water, hydrogen, methane, and ammonia, a combination that would be deadly to most modern forms of life. In fact, these very gases reacted with each other - prompted by lightning , ultraviolet light, or some other form of energy - to create chemical compounds from which life on earth began. Scientists have conducted experiments to recreate this process. By first producing a combination of gases similar to that of the earth's atmosphere billions of years ago and then directing bolts of energy, to simulate lightning, through the mixture, scientists have managed to create a chemical reaction which produces amino acids and other chemical compounds found in all known forms of life.
