Scientists have achieved a broad understanding of how the human body transforms the raw materials it obtains from food into the 45 nutrients needed to fuel activity and build cells. Food is digested in the alimentary canal which extends from the mouth to the anus. Digestion is a process by which meat, fish, vegetables, and grains are physically and chemically transformed into simple substances that can be more readily dissolved. Then the nutrients from these substance are absorbed by tissues surrounding part of the canal and transported to the 100 trillion cells that need them to produce energy or build body tissue. Unabsorbed residues pass through the small intestine into the large intestine, where they are stored for variable periods before being eliminated from the body.
