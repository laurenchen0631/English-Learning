The world's consuming energies are tremendous rad, and a major organic fuel sources, coal, wood, petroleum and agricultural wastes are being depleted. In the last century used these fuels total almost half of that used in preceding 19th century and consumption is expected to continue growing by about 25 percent by the year 2000. As scientists seek new way to maximize power of available fuels, a global hunts are underway for new reserves. And other challenge will be to find totally new energy sources to support growing population and future form's technology. Some of the possibilities include tapping the energy of winds and tides, expanding the use of the solar power, utilizing heat from the earth, harnessing the energy of lasers and nuclear fusion.
