The oceans are the chief source of rain, but lakes and rivers also contribute to it. The sun's heat evaporates the water. It remains in the atmosphere as an invisible vapor unit it condenses, first into clouds, and then into raindrops. Condensation happens when the air is cooled.

Air cools either through expansion or by coming into contact with a cool object such as cold landmass or ice-covered expanse. When air passes over a cold object, it lose its heat at moisture condensed as fog, dur, or frost. Air also cools as rise as expanse. The water vapor in the cooling air condenses to form clouds and, sometimes, rain.

Air rises for several reasons. Convergent lift occurs in cyclonic storms such as tornados. Air whirling toward the center of a cyclone collide with itself and is forced upward. In convective lift air coming into contact with warm surface such as desert is heated and become more boing than the surrounding air. In oralgraphic lift the air is forced upward as encounters a cooler, denser body of air or when it meets raised landforms such as mountains.

For raindrops to form, there must be particulate matter in the air such as dust or salt at temperature above freezing. These particles are called condensation nuclei. When the nuclei are cooled to temperature below the freezing point, water condenses around them in layers. The particles become so heavy that resist updrift and fall through the clouds. When the air temperature is at or below freezing all the way to the ground, the precipitation falls as snow.

Air cools either through expansion or by coming into contact with a cool object such as a cold landmass or an ice-covered expanse. When air passes over a cold object, it loses heat and its moisture condenses as fog, dew, or frost. Air also cools as it rises and expands.

Air rises for several reasons. Convergent life occurs in cyclonic storms such as tornados. Air whirling toward the center of a cyclone collides with itself and is forced upward. In convective lift, air coming into contact with a warm surface, such as a desert, is heated and becomes more buoyant than the surrounding air. In orographic lift, the air is forced upward as it encounters a cooler, denser body of air or when it meets raised landforms such as mountains.

For raindrops to form, there must be particulate matter in the air, such as dust or salt, at temperatures above freezing. These particles are called condensation nuclei. When the nuclei are cooled to temperatures below the freezing point, water condenses around them in layers. The particles become so heavy that they resist updrafts and fall through the clouds. When the air temperature is at or below freezing all the way to the ground, the precipitation falls as snow.
