One learns that a burning candle is hot by feeling the heat. The ability of the brain to register the notion of heat, remember it, and later recall it means that a specific piece of information has been learned. Memory, therefore, is essential to learning.

Learning is a selective process. Far more is perceived than remembered. Otherwise, the mind would be a storehouse miscellaneous, unassorted data.

There appear to be 3 levels of memory: immediate, short-term, and long-term. Immediate memory lasts no more than a couple of seconds, the time it takes for sensory impression to register. Short-term memory is a matter of seconds or minutes. One looks up a phone number in directory and makes a call by the time that call is completed the number has normally been forgotten. Long-term memory can last a life time, but some experts believe that information may be lost through disuse or may become flawed through reinterpretation.

Information often is transferred from short-term to long-term memory. One way this is done is by repetition and rehearsal, much the way an actor may memorize his or her lines from a script. Novel or vivid experiences seem to be more readily shifted to long-term memory. Others means of transfer are by the association of unfamiliar name or fact with something that is already known, or grouping things together so fewer facts at a time need to be absorbed. Many strategies are taught for improving memory, and most people developed their own devices.
