Massage is a proven cure to stress. No one knows precisely how the massaging of flesh quiets the stress response but the effect can be dramatic. Over the past 23 years, psychologist Tiffany Field, of the University of Miami's Touch Research Institute, has published studies suggesting that it can hasten weight gain in early birth babies, improve lung function in asthmatics, and increase immune function in men with HIV. Healthy people may benefit too. In a 1996 study, medical workers who got ten weekly massages outscore their colleagues who didn't receive massage on time of math tests.

There are many options, from yoga to biofeedback to music therapy, and none of them excludes the others. So do what works for you. And whether you go to church, join a support group or start a diary, find a way to talk about your feelings. Studies suggest that the group support can extend the lives of people with skinner breast cancer, and researchers show recently that people with asthma or rheumatoid arthritis can ease their sickness by writing about the most stressful events in their lives.

Anything - encouraging a sense of control, putting a terrible memory into words, coming a racing heart through breathing exercises, even planning your own funeral - lets you start feeling like a victim.
