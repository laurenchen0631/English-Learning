[Listened Article]
Scientists have discovered a disturbing unintended consequence of genetic engineering, pollen from a widely planted laboratory designed strain of corn can kill monarch butterflies. 

Monarch caterpillars eating milky leaves dust with pollen from the outer corn plants eat less, grow more slowly, and die more quickly. After four days, 44% of them had died versus none of the caterpillars that did not feed on pollen.

Monarchs are not an endangered species, but environmentalists fear that if genetically engineered corn is killing the original black butterflies it might be killing other insects and doing other unseen damage to the food chain.

The strain is called Bt corn and is manufactured by major agricultural companies. The corn is genetically engineered to produce a nature pesticide that kills corn-destroying European corn borer.

It was approved in the US by the Food and Drug Administration and hit the market in 1996. It accounted for more than 25% of 40 million hectares of corn planted in the US in 1998.

Bt corn has been touted by the industry as a way to fight a major pest without using chemicals.

Scientists have discovered a disturbing unintended consequence of genetic engineering: pollen from a widely planted, laboratory-designed strain of corn can kill monarch butterflies.

Monarch caterpillars eating milkweed leaves dusted with pollen from the altered corn plants ate less, grew more slowly, and died more quickly. After four days, 44 percent of them had died versus none of the caterpillars that did not feed on the pollen.

Monarchs are not an endangered species, but environmentalists fear that if the genetically engineered corn is killing the orange-and-black butterflies, it might be killing other insects and doing other unseen damage to the food chain.

The strain is called Bt corn and it manufactured by major agricultural companies. The corn is genetically engineered to produce a nature pesticide that kills the corn-destroying European corn borer.
