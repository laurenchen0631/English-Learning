Latitudinal variations in the input of solar energy are due to two factors. First, the Earth is a sphere and the angle at which sun rays hit its surface varies from 90 degrees, or vertical near the equator, to 0 degrees, or horizontal near the Poles. Less energy is received at the Poles because the same amount of radiation is spread out over much larger area at hight latitudes, and because of high latitudes the suns rays must travel through a much greater thickness of atmosphere where more absorb and reflection occur.

The second factor affecting latitudinal variations in heating is the duration of daylight. Because polar axis of the Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.5° with respect to ecliptic. We have a progressional seasons where the angle of the sun's ray striking at any given point varies over the year. In the Northern Hemisphere winter, no sunlight strikes the area around the North Pole during a full day's rotation of the Earth, because it is in the Earth's shadow. Thus, little or no solar heating occurs in this area at this time. Conversely, at the South Pole there is continual daylight but at very low sun angle during the Northern Hemisphere winter. As the seasons shift, the South Polar region eventually becomes plunged into 24-hour darkness just as the North Pole had been earlier. Low-latitude region near the equator, by contrast, undergo little seasonal change in the duration of the daylight, whereas intermediate latitudes are subjected to changes intermediate between those of the Poles and the equator. Thus, because of seasonality, more annual radiation is received per unit area at lower as compared to higher latitudes.
