Close living arrangements between two different species is called symbiosis. The word comes from the Greek word meaning state of living together. Usually the two organisms are in close physical contact with one living on or in the other. In some cases, however, the relationship is less intimate. Symbiosis is classified into: mutualism, once called symbiosis, commensalism, and parasitism. This relationship ranges from mutually beneficial to harmful or even fatal for one of the species.

In mutualism both partners benefit from the relationship. One of the best known mutual relationships is one between nitrogen-fixing riseobian bacteria and several leguminous plants such as beans, peas, peanut, and ?.

Human beings, animals, and most plants need nitrogen to survive, but cannot metabolize it from the air. Riseobian bacteria which live in soil enter the roots of legums and produce najoce or enlargements in which they absorb nitrogen from the air and convert it into ammonia. This compound is then converted into some organic form such as amino acids which are shared by bacteria and host plants. By eating such leguminous plants other organisms obtain a rich source of nitrogen-bearing compound. The bacteria in turn benefit from the relationship by absorbing from the host plant nutrients that they cannot manufacture themselves.

Lichens which consist of fungi and algae are another well-known example of mutualism. Algae receive shelter and a moist environment by dwelling within the fungi. In turn algae provide the fungi with food through photosynthesis.

In mutualism both partners benefit from the relationship. One of the best-known mutual relationships is the one between nitro-fixing Rhizobium bacteria and several leguminous plants such as beans, peas, peanuts, and alfalfa.

Human beings, animals, and most plants need nitrogen to survive but cannot metabolize it from the air. Rhizobium bacteria, which live in soil, enter the roots of legumes and produce nodules, or enlargements, in which they absorb nitrogen from the air and convert it into ammonia. This compound is then converted into some organic form, such as amino acids, which is shared by the bacteria and the host plants. By eating such leguminous plants, other organisms obtain a rich source of nitrogen-bearing compounds. The bacteria, in turn, benefit from the relationship by absorbing from the host plant nutrients that they cannot manufacture themselves.
