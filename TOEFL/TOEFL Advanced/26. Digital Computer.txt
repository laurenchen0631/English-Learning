[Listened Article]
A digital computer typically consists of a control unit, an arithmetic-logic unit, a memory unit, and input/output units. The arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) performs simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and logic operation such as OR and AND. The main computer memory, usually high-speed random-access memory (RAM), stores instructions and data. The control unit fetches data and instructions from memory and affects the operations of the ALU. The control unit and ALU usually are referred to as a processor, or central processing unit (CPU). The operational speed of the CPU primarily determines the speed of the computer as a whole. The basic operation of the CPU is analogous to computation carried out by a person using an arithmetic calculator. The control unit corresponds to the human brain and memory to a notebook that stores the program, initial data, and intermediate and final computational results. In the case of electronic computer, the CPU and fast memories are realized with transistor circuits.

I/O units, or devices, are commonly referred to as computer peripherals and consist of input units, such as keyboards and optimal scanners, for feeding instructions and data into the computer and output units, such as printers and monitors, for displaying results. In addition to RAM, a computer usually contains some slower but larger and permanent secondary memory storage. Almost all computers contain a magnetic storage device known as a hard disk as well as a disk drive to read from or write to removable magnetic media known as floppy disks.
