Because the plates cover the global, if it separates in one place, they must converge somewhere else, and they do. Plates collide head-on along their convergent boundaries.

A profusion of geological activities is associated with a plate collision. One plate sinks beneath the other, a process called subduction. Ocean lithosphere thus descend into ??sphere. This down blink produces a long, narrow deep-sea trench about one hundred kilometers wide, where the ocean flow reaches its greatest depth about 10 kilometers below sea level. The edge of the overriding plate is crumpled and uplifted to form a mountain chain roughly parallel to the trench. The ? forces of collision and subduction produce great earthquakes. Material may be scraped off the descending slab and incorporate into adjacent mountains. Imagine yourself as a geologist attempting to figure out the meaning of such tangled evidence. Furthermore, during subduction parts of the descending plate may begin to melt. Magma formed where plates sink into the mantle floats upward, and can reach the surface and erupt from volcanos.

Recall that divergent zones are sources of new lithosphere. Subduction zones at boundary of convergence are sinks in which lithosphere is consumed by being returned to the mantle.

Because the plates cover the globe, if they separate in one place, they must converge somewhere else; and they do. Plates collide head on along their convergent boundaries.

A profusion of geologic activities is associated with a plate collision. One plate sinks beneath the other, a process called "subduction." Ocean lithosphere thus descends into the asthenosphere. This downbuckling produces a long, narrow deep-seatrench (about 10 km wide), where the ocean floor reaches its greatest depths (about 10 km below sea level). The 
edge of the overriding plate is crumpled and uplifted to form a mountain chain roughly parallel to the trench. The enormous forces of collision and subduction produce great earthquakes. Materials may be scraped off the descending slab and incorporated into the adjacent mountains. Imagine yourself as a geologist attempting to figure out the meaning of such tangled evidence. Furthermore, during subduction, parts of the descending plate may begin to melt. Magma formed where plates sink into the mantle floats upward, and can reach the surface and erupt from volcanos.
