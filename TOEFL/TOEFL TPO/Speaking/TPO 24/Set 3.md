According to the letter, a student proposes that campus coffeehouse should be closed because no many students use it and the food there isn't very good. However, the women disagree with the opinion for 2 reasons.

First off, she feels that not many students using it is an advantage for her and many students. Because the place is not crowded and quiet, many students prefer the coffeehouse as a place to study over the library.

Secondly, in fact, the food there become much better recently. A new manager came to the coffeehouse and improve the quality of the food. She feels the dishes are actually more delicious than before.

## Close the Campus Coffee house
I propose that the university close the campus coffeehouse. Coffeehouses are great, if people actually use them, like to socialize with friends, while enjoying a cup of coffee and a snack. But students are not using our campus coffeehouse. There are usually lots of empty tables when I pass by the place. It's just a waste of space that could be used for other things. Also, the food at the coffeehouse is not very good. The last time I was there, the cakes and muffins my friends and I ordered were dry and didn't have much flavor.
Sincerely,

## Discussion
NARRATOR: Now listen to two students discussing the letter.

<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> I don't like his proposal.

<-MALE STUDENT:-> Why not? There are never many students in there.

<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> But that's what I like about it...

that it's never crowded.

<-MALE STUDENT:-> Really?

<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, so it's a great place to study.

I go there a lot...I'll read a book or bring my laptop computer and work on a paper for class.

It's never very noisy.<-MALE STUDENT:-> You're able to get work done there?<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Absolutely!In fact, I actually prefer it to the library as a place to study...

and a lot of other students do too.

We even study for our final exams there.

And you can eat there while you work, something you can't do at the library.

<-MALE STUDENT:-> OK, but you don't actually like the food there, do you? I mean, he said...

<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> [interrupting] Well, I don't think he's been there recently.

I mean, it's true that it wasn't that great in the past, but I think it's a lot better now.

<-MALE STUDENT:-> What's changed?

<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> They have a new manager, and I guess she's made some improvements in the quality of the food.

I was there last week and the food was delicious.

<-MALE STUDENT:-> [slightly skeptical] Really?

<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah really!

And the new manager has also added a lot of really healthful foods and snacks, so the food doesn't just taste good nowâ€”it's good for you too.

<-MALE STUDENT:-> Hmm. I'll have to try the place.
