Personally, I believe students benefit more from larger classes than small-sized classes. I feel this way for 2 reasons.

First off, discussion are more intensive in large classes. For example, if there are 100 people in a classroom, it is more likely that some one argue with the professor's point of view. And then, another student will do this and another over and over. You can learn much more in the situation.

Secondly, competition among students are greater. For instance, in small class, students could be comfortable because the grades of the students in the class are not so different which cause them to feel that effort is useless in the unnecessary.
