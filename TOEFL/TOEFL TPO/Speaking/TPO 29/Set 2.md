Personally, I prefer to study in a place with few people around. I feel this way for two reasons.

First off, it help to concentrate. For example, if there are many people around me, there must be more noises that could interrupt my thinking. Thus, a quiet location is good at concentrating for me.

Secondly, nowadays online communication is convenient. To be specific, there is no need to call a friend or ask one to study with me for resolving my questions. I could only leave a message to someone know the answer, and maybe a few minutes later, he can eliminate your my doubts.
