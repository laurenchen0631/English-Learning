According to the letter, a student proposes to remove Old Bicycles from Campus Racks because some of bikes won't be missed by anyone and it can free up more space on the tracks. Futhermore, the woman agree with the proposal for 2 reasons.

First off, there are many broken bicycles there which lack some parts like handling bar. When it comes to those normal bikes, school could attach some warning notes on those bikes that is still needed by its owner. 

Secondly, she feels that it is hard to find a place to park her bike. For example, she want to eat at the dinning hall, she even need to park her bike at another building and walk to the dinning hall because the parking location front of the dinning hall abound with old bikes.

## Remove Old Bicycles from Campus Racks
I noticed that there are bicycles locked to the campus bicycle racks that have not been moved for a long time. I think the university should remove these bikes from the racks and dispose of them. I recommend this action because, first of all, they will not be missed by anyone, since they apparently have been forgotten by their owners. More importantly, removing the bikes would help to free up space on the racks, thereby benefiting people who are actually using their bikes and need places to park them. Sincerely, 
James Keena

<-NARRATOR:-> Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> He's totally right about this, you know...
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Well, I agree they should do it, but maybe it's not fair.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> What-just assuming no one wants them?
Well, judging from the condition some of them are in, I think it's probably a safe assumption.
I mean, some are missing parts like handlebars or wheels...
and others are really rusty, like they've been left outside in the rain for years.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, the ones with missing parts sure don't look like they're being used.
But what if some are?
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Well, to be sure, the university could always attach notes to them...
and, say, give the owners two weeks to remove them or they'd be removed by campus security.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, that'd probably work.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Anyway, it'd be a really big help if they were gone.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Oh, I know.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Because, I mean, especially like in front of the dining hall,
there're lots of them there... and... it can be really hard to find a space...
all the spaces are always taken there.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, it's bad.
Lots of people ride bikes these days.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> And since the university doesn't allow us to tie them to sign posts or fences, or anything like that to park them...
I always have to lock mine up at another building and walk over to the dining hall.. .'
cause there's hardly ever a space.
