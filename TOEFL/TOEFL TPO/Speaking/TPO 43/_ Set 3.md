According to the announcement, the university plants to do some change to orientation program that students can choose which event they want to attend and it take only one day because it attract more students and some students request it. Furthermore, the man agree with the change for 2 reasons.

First off, not every likes the same thing. For example, many people don't like sleep in a tent, and then they decide not to participate, even though they like hiking. 

Secondly, because the time is reduced from 2 days to one day, first-year students will have a day to do some preparation like buying books, setting up the rooms.

## University Makes Changes to Orientation Program
Madison University is making a change to the orientation program for first-year students. In the past, as part of orientation, new, incoming students could go on a two-day hiking and camping trip together with other incoming students on the weekend before classes begin. In order to encourage more students to take advantage of the opportunity to get to know one another in an informal setting, the university will now offer a choice of activities: students will be able to either go hiking or participate in organized group games on campus. Additionally, these activities will last one day only, not two, a change many students had requested.

## Lecture
<-NARRATOR:-> Now listen to two students discussing the article.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Interesting isn't it?
I wish they'd made this change two years ago, when we got here.
The program's going to be much more attractive this way... to lots more people.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Why?
<-MALE STUDENT:-> It's a question of choice.
See, not everyone likes the same things. The way it used to be, if,
like, you didn't like sleeping in a tent, well you just
didn't participate. Lots of people didn't.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> That's true. I didn't go on the camping trip my first year-
hiking and camping isn't my thing-
but you know I did feel I missed out on something.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Right.Plus, the other reason this is going to work
is that you don't have to give up your whole weekend anymore.
There are other things people need to do their first few days...you know, like buy their books, set up their rooms,
prepare for the first day of classes, that kind of thing.
The big time commitment used to get in the way.
