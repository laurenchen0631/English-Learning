Personally, I believe that students should attend college full time rather than part-time. I feel this way for two reasons. 

First off, college professor would be different and more options there. For example, I have a job at daytime and I attend course at night. Most of professors have their own schedule and thus major of them won't host a class at night. 

Secondly, people you meet in college would be more colorful. To be specific, if you only attend some classes during the specific time period, it's more likely that you meet same students focusing on their business; thus, the kind of people you met is limited.
