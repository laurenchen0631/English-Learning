## Set 1 Response
Recently, I had the final exam. It's important because I need to get a good score so I can have a high GPA, it allows me to find a good job after graduation. It means that I can do whatever job I like. I can earn lot of money so I can buy a big house for my parents. Also, a good job can give me a sense of achievement. I can make me happy and I can learn a lot from colleagues and leaders, so I can improve myself to be a better person.

## Set 5 Listening
NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between two students.
MALE STUDENT: Hey, Beth, how're things?
FEMALE STUDENT: Not great...
MALE STUDENT: Why? What's wrong?
FEMALE STUDENT: I just found out I have to move out of my apartment ... like, right away.
MALE STUDENT: You're kidding? Why?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, my apartment ...
it's in a house ...a kinda old house.
And now something's wrong with the water pipes.
I think some of the pipes burst or wore out or something.
Anyway, we don't have any water in the house ... and apparently it's gonna take about two weeks to fix the problem.
MALE STUDENT: So you need to find a place to live for what ...
two weeks or so?
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah.Bad timing, huh?
With midterm exams coming up and everything.
MALE STUDENT: So have you figured out what you're going to do?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, some friends said I could stay at their place ...
they don't have an extra bedroom, but they said it'd be OK for me to sleep on their living room couch.
MALE STUDENT: You could probably handle that for a couple of weeks, right?
FEMALE STUDENT: I guess so. I mean it's really nice of them to offer ... and it's free.
The only problem is ... they already have four people living there, so it could be a little crowded.
MALE STUDENT: And not ideal for studying for midterms.
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, too many distractions.
MALE STUDENT: Any other options?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well ... I did find this place-it's a small hotel over on Third Street, right near campus ...
MALE STUDENT: Oh, right. A lot of kids' parents stay there when they come for a visit.
FEMALE STUDENT: Right. So I could get a room there.
They have a weekly rate ... and it's pretty reasonable. But, I don't know ...
MALE STUDENT: At least at the hotel you'd have a space of your own, you know, so you could get more done.
FEMALE STUDENT: That's definitely a plus ... but I have to think about it ...
even though it's pretty cheap, it'll still end up costing me some money ... and my budget's pretty tight right now.
