In my opinion, I believe that  family members are more influential on young adults than their friends. I feel this way for 2 reasons.

First off, family members accompany with you since you are still young. People are unconsciously affected by their parents. For example, you watched your parents doing many things. If the parents are modest and humble, the child will become less showy and uncouth at least after they are adults.

Secondly, family members educate their descendants from youth. There are few parents that only spoil their child. That is to say, most parents scold their child when they do something incorrect. This early education shapes the personality and morality of the adults.
