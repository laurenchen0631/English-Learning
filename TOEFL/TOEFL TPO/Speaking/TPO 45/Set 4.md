The passage introduces the concept of Method of Loci which is a Special techniques to help us recall information in a particular order. The professor illustrates the idea with the example of walking and planets.

At first, you want to name planets by the distance from Sun. The Method of Loci is to associate the planets with the landmarks along your walking route. For example, you walk from dorm room to the student center. Then, you associate door with Mercury, along the path there is a big tree that you think it as Venus, and so on. In real situation, when you want to remember the sequence of planets in a test, you can imagine the route from your dorm room to the student center. I first met the door so you think up Mercury as first planet. Then, in memory, next landmark is a big tree which means Venus. Put simply, along the route, you recall the sequence of planets.

## Method of Loci
Special techniques, or memory devices, are often used to help us recall information. One technique, the method of loci (i.e., method of location), is particularly helpful for remembering several pieces of information in a particular order. To use this technique, we first imagine a familiar place such as a building or an outdoor area. This familiar place should have a series of landmarks or locations within it that we can imagine walking past in a predictable, logical order. Once the landmarks have been identified in a given order, we assign one piece of the information that we want to later recall to each location. The information should be assigned in the order in which we want to remember it. To later recall the new information in order, we imagine walking through the familiar place, recalling what is stored at each location along the way.

## Lecture
<-NARRATOR:-> Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic.
<-MALE PROFESSOR:-> So how would this work?
Well, let's say you need to learn the names of the planets-
in order, by distance from the Sun.
So first, think about the landmarks you pass as you walk from, say, your dormitory to the student center.
The first one might be...the front door of your dormitory,
then the big tree in front of the dorm...
the next landmark you pass might be the statue in front of the library;
next, the steps to the science building...
you get the idea.
You memorize the major points along the walk...
imagining yourself going from the first landmark,
to the second, the third, and so on.
Now the next thing you do
is assign one planet to each of your landmarks...in sequence.
Since Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun,
you assign it to the first landmark-
the front door of your dorm.
The next planet,
Venus, to the tree in front of the dorm...
the third planet, Earth,
you assign to the third landmark, the statue in front of the library...
and so on and so on.
And each time you picture the association in your mind as vividly as possible.
Then later...
say you're sitting in the classroom taking a test
and you have to write the order of the planets from the Sun.
What do you do?
You imagine yourself on that familiar walk to the student center,
passing each landmark as usual.
When you think about walking out the door of your dorm,
you're reminded of Mercury.
When you see the beautiful tree in front of the dorm,
you think of Venus...
at each landmark along the way,
you recall the next planet
and write it down.
