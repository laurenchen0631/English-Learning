Personally, I believe that Artists and musicians are important to a society. I feel this way for 2 reasons.

First off, other fields also need the skill. For example, tv drama or video games need music and art to help people to immerse in the story. Brilliant music and art makes the works more realistic.

Secondly, art and music could be used a way to relax or be a entertainment. For instance, after a day of work, I'd like to listen to music at night since it makes me relaxed and ready to face tomorrow's challenge. Considering the same reason, some people may also appreciate art works in museum.
