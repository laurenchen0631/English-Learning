## Notes
1. keep stu attention: two types of attention
2. active,: intentional focus, x long time, biology, frog, ~~~~ boring, force themselves concentr
3. passive: x effort, x force, without think about it, biology, jump around, engaging, until frog is still there.

## Content
In the lecture, the professor talks about two types of attention: the active and the passive. She then use the example of biology class about frog to illustrates this concept.

The first type of attention: active attention. It is an intentional focus which last shorter than the passive attention. For example, in the biology class, the lecturer introduces the frog with many boring details and content. At first, the students will force themselves concentrated, but however, after a short period, they cannot keep it anymore.

The second type is passive attention. It doesn't require any effort or force to concentrate. It can be attained even without thinking about it. Taking another biology class for example, rather than starting with boring introduction, the lecturer pull the frog from the case at first. And, describing the knowledge with this living frog as the model. Because the lecturer do something unexpected and engaging, this has the students focus longer by provoking their passive attention.

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to part of a talk in an *education* class.
FEMALE PROFESSOR: One of the hardest parts of teaching is keeping your students' attention.
Now, the key to doing this is understanding the concept of attention.
Basically, there are two types of attention.
The first type is 'active'.
Active attention is voluntary.
It's when you intentionally make yourself focus on something.
And since it requires effort, it's hard to keep up for a long time.
Ok, so, um, let's say you're teaching a, a biology class, and today's topic is 'frogs', all right?
You're standing at the front of the room and lecturing: "A-frog-is-a-type-of-animal-known-as-an-amphibian.
' Well, this isn't necessarily going to keep the students' interest.
But most of them will force themselves to pay active attention to your lecture.
But it's only a matter of time before they get distracted.
Now the other type of attention is passive attention when it's involuntary.
Passive attention requires no effort because it happens naturally.
If something's really interesting, students don't have to force themselves to pay attention to it.
They do it without even thinking about it.
So, back to our biology lecture, you start talking about frogs, and then you pull a live frog out of your briefcase.
You're describing it while you hold it up, show the students how long its legs are and, and how they're used for jumping, for example.
Then, maybe you'll even let the frog jump around a bit on the desk or the floor.
In this case, by doing something unexpected, something more engaging, you can tap in to their passive attention and it can last much longer than active attention.
As long as the frog is still there, your students will be interested.

## Topic
Using points and examples from the talk, explain the two types of motivation.
