## Set 5 Listening
NARRATOR: Now listen to a conversation between a professor and a student.
MALE PROFESSOR: Hi, Sara.
Uh, to what do I owe the pleasure of this office visit?
FEMALE STUDENT: It's my *study group*, Professor Wilson.
We are not getting much studying done. And, you know, not all of us did very well on your last quiz.
MALE PROFESSOR: Hmm... What's the problem?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, we've all become good friends and we joke around a lot instead of studying.
MALE PROFESSOR:Hmm... Sara, let me ask you this.
When do you meet?
FEMALE STUDENT: Every Friday afternoon.
MALE PROFESSOR: Have you thought about changing to another day?
By the time Friday afternoon rolls around, all of you are probably exhausted, and um, all you want to do is relax and um, *unwind*.
It's hard to stay focused at the very end of the week.
FEMALE STUDENT: Good point!
Although things have gotten so out of hand that I'm not sure changing days would help.
And we'd lose one or two people if we change days.
Friday afternoon is the only time everyone is available.
But it's worth considering.
MALE PROFESSOR: OK.
But, just a second, another possibility is, does your group have a leader?
No.
MALE PROFESSOR: Well, if you had a leader that would help enormouslyâ€”
Someone to set an agenda in advance, email it to everyone before the meeting
and then make sure when you meet that you stay focused on your goals.
And since you seem to be concerned enough about the problem to have come see me, I think that someone might be you.
FEMALE STUDENT: I guess I could take on that role, but it sounds like work.
MALE PROFESSOR: You don't have to do it for the whole semester, Sara.
You can start it off and then perhaps someone else can take over.

## Set 5 Topic 
The professor proposes two solutions to the problem the woman describes. Briefly summarize the problem. Then state which solution you recommend and explain why.

## Set 5 Response
The problem the woman is dealing with is that the members of her study group did not do very well in the quiz because they have become good friends and always joke around instead of studying.The professor in the conversation proposes two suggestions:

Firstly, they can change the time they meet from Friday afternoon to other time because students all feel exhausted and want to relax on that time.  Secondly, he proposes the woman to be a leader to organize the group and help them focus on study.

In me view, the better option is the second one. Firstly, if they change the time, some students might not be available.
Secondly, being the leader of the group can not only help the group focus on study but also help her build a lot of highly-valued qualities like leadership, organization skills.
