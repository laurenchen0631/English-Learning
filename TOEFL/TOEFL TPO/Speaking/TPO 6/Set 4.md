## Notes
1. explicit memory = conscious or intentional recollection - last night dinner
2. implicit memory = x conscious - highway, billboard, x remember all, still affect
3. panther, above board, advertise, x remember, dif question - pig (x) they say panther

## Content
The passage introduces the concept of implicit memory, which means an unconscious recollection that people cannot recall yet still display reactions. The professor, he, illustrates the point with the example of billboards in a highway. 

When people drives through a highway, they don't remember the content or meaning of those billboards. However, the content still affect them unconsciously. For example, there is a billboard which is a car advertisement with the word "panther" on it. If you ask the people driving through it about whether they see any car advertisement, they would say no. On the other hand, if you ask them to think a word starting with 'p', instead of 'pig', the most common word, they would say 'panther'.

## Vocab

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a psychology class.
MALE PROFESSOR: OK, uh... the first kind of memory, we're all very familiar with this, right?
You probably remember what you had for dinner last night - you have a Conscious Memory of last night's dinner.
So, um, if I ask you 'what did you eat last night?' you could tell me.
But these other kind of memories - 'implicit Memories', they work differently.
Let's take an example from the world of advertising.
When you're driving along a highway, you'll see plenty of billboards - you know, road-side advertisements.
You certainly don't remember them all.
But they still affect you.
Marketing researchers have shown, well, to be specific, let's say there's a billboard on the highway advertising a ... car, called the 'Panther'.
The ad shows a big picture of a car and above the car in huge letters is the name of the car- 'Panther'.
A lot of people drive by the billboard.
But ask those drivers later if they saw any advertisements for cars, and well, they'll think about it and a lot of them will say 'no'.
They honestly don't remember seeing any.
They have no conscious memory of the 'Panther' billboard.
So, you ask the same people a different question.
You ask, um...ok, um...you ask them to name an animal starting with the letter 'p'.
What do you think they'll answer?
Do they say 'pig'?
'Pig' is the most common animal that starts with the letter 'p', but they don't say 'pig'.
They say 'Panther'.
The billboard had an effect even though the drivers don't remember ever seeing it.

## Passage
In everyday life, when people speak of memory, they are almost always speaking about what psychologists would call explicit memories. An *explicit memory is a conscious or intentional recollection*, usually of facts, names, events, or other things that a person can state or declare. *There is another kind of memory that is not conscious*. Memories of this kind are called *implicit memories*. An individual can have *an experience that he or she cannot consciously recall yet still display reactions* that indicate the experience has been somehow recorded in his or her brain.

Using the professor's examples, explain the advertising technique of target marketing.
