Personally, I believe that in the future still read as many books as we do today. I feel this way for 2 reasons.

First off, even technology progress, there are still many texts to read. For example, in a website or Wikipedia, we can't learn a topic without reading so much texts. Maybe physical book will disappearing but the approach to learning knowledge still remain. 

Secondly, literature is still diversified. For instance, you still can see many various books in a bookstore. Abstract books are still be used us a way to convey our idea or thought to next generation, which means the books they need to read conversely increase.
