According to the letter, a student proposes that the university should publish Professor Evaluations to students because professor and students also benefits: professor are motivated to change their teaching style and students can know which classes are better. However, the woman disagree with the proposal for 2 reasons.

First, professor will not be too happy to be criticized. And some intentionally negative reviews will emerge, which cause the professor to ignore those review. So, they won't change their teaching style at all.

Secondly, most of the reviews are not specific enough to provide some useful information to students because most of students are not willing to spend a lot of time on writing the review.

## Professor Evaluations
The university requires students to complete written evaluations of their professors at the end of each course taught during the semester. But current system is private, since only the professors actually read the evaluations once the student submit them. I suggest that the university publish these evaluation online for everyone to read. Both professors and students would benefit from having these evaluation published. Professor would feel more motivated to improve their teaching if they knew that their evaluations were publicly available to all students. In addition, prospective students could read the evaluation and make more informed decisions about which classes they want ti take. Sincerely, Chris Jacobs

## Talking
<-NARRATOR:-> Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Did you see this?
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, but I don't think it'll work.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Why not?
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Well, I don't think professors would be **too happy to have their teaching styles publicly criticized.**
Besides, **they might not even bother reading the online evaluations, if they think there will be negative criticism in them.**
<-MALE STUDENT:-> You really think that'll happen?
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Sure.And so the professors won't take them seriously or be influenced in any way . . .
nothing's going to change.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> OK. But at least students who might take their courses in the future will read them.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> That's true. But students who write the evaluations **usually do it on the last day of class and they're all in a hurry to leave.**
They don't want to **bother spending much time on them, so they don't say anything specific or helpful** about the professor or the course.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> I see what you mean.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:->So this whole idea may not work at all.
