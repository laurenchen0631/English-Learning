According to the syllabus, the course intends to use an oral presentation as final project because the students can understand the rewards and challenges of cooperation and can learn more from the other's work. However, the woman disagree with the idea for 2 reasons.

First off, work depending on someones else makes her nervous. For example, she has a roommate who worked for a group project. However, since other group members didn't attend to discussion, the roommate took all task alone. In other words, she think that group project could hurt her grade if the partner is irresponsible.

Secondly, learn from other's presentation is nearly impossible because the time is close to final exams. Most of students will focus only on their project and other tests, so they won't listen other's presentation at all.

## Talk
<-NARRATOR:-> Now listen to two students discussing the assignment.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> [doubtful] I don't know about this.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Why not? Sounds OK to me.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Thing is, depending on someone else makes me nervous.
My roommate had to do a project like this, and the other girl didn't show up to meetings, didn't do any research-
my roommate had to do everything herself.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> That's a drag. I guess if your partner's irresponsible, you're out of luck.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Exactly. It hurt her grade.
I don't want the same thing to happen to me.
Right now I'm more concerned with getting a good grade, even though I know that's not the lesson the professor has in mind.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Still, it'll be good to listen to everyone's stuff.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> [doubtful] Well, I don't know.
I mean, at the end of the semester, people are focused on studying for exams.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Yeah.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Who has time to put something like this together when they're busy studying?
<-MALE STUDENT:-> True.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> I can't imagine anyone' ll be able to really do a good job with it.
And everyone' ll be so preoccupied by then
that they probably won't listen anyway.
I think the professor's gonna be disappointed, and students? Well, we'll all just be frustrated by the whole thing.

## Final Project
The final project for this course will be an oral presentation. Students must work with an assigned partner to select a topic and complete all related research for the project. The partners will orally present their research to the class during the last two weeks of classes. This project will provide students with the opportunity to discover the rewards and challenges of working with another individual, an experience that will help them in future endeavors. Furthermore, these presentations will benefit the entire class: when students share their discoveries with the class, they enable other students to learn from their work.

## Topic 
The woman expresses her opinion of the assignment. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.
