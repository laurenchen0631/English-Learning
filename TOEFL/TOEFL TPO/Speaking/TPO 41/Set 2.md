Personally, I believe that university money should only be used for academic purposes rather than entertainment. I feel this way for 2 reasons.

First off, university should provide necessary and abundant educational resources. For example, you might need school to provide more books in library and some software on Internet. Unlike entertainment, only those resources are essential students to learn better at university.

Secondly, entertainment can be found elsewhere. For instance, you can find movies, video games and music online. If the university is close to the city, you can also found shopping malls or theaters without any support from university.
