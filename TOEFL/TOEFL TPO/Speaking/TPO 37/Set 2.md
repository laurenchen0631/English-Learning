Personally, I believe that students will more efficiently if the teacher is kind and friendly. I feel this way for 2 reasons.

First off, good experience encourage students to learn willingly. For example, there was a teacher that was kind to the whole classmates. The students could be more willing to learn in the kind of students because of positive memory.

Secondly, threatening is only temporary method. For instance, I could force some one to learn by abusing or violence. However, when I was gone, the person would definitely stop. That is to say, kindness can lead to permanent learning.
