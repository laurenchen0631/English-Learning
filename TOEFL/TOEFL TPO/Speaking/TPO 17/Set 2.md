Personally, I believe that it is better to allow students to bring cellphones into the classroom. I feel this way for 2 reason.

First off, it is hard to prevent. To be specific, if schools or teachers want to prevent students from taking their cellphones, they need to check what they bring to the school every single day. This behavior is very annoying and unnecessary to most of cases.

Secondly, if some emergencies happen students can know them quickly. For example, in my country, there will be an alert announcing from cellphone when an earthquake nearly start. If students hear the alert, they could take necessary actions immediately.
