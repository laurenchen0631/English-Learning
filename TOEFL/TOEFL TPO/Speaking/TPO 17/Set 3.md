According to the announcement, the library plans to change their tables into one-person desks because it provide more privacy, eliminate noises and have more space to face the recent increase in the number of students. However, the man, disagree with the decision for 2 reasons.

First off, group project is still common at school. Instead of replacing all tables, the library should build some  meeting rooms which reduce noise in the library. There is no much need in isolation.

Secondly, about the increasing number of the students, according to the experience of the man and the woman, both of them didn't encounter any overcrowded issue recently. It shows that there is no urgent requirement to increase the number of the seats.

## New Library Workspaces
Say good-bye to the big, multiperson study tables in Turner Library. This summer, the tables will be exchanged for new personal study cubiclesâ€”small, one-person desks enclosed by walls. These new units will allow students to have privacy and work in isolation and will therefore eliminate noise in the library so students can concentrate. Additionally, the cubicles will enable the library to accommodate the recent increase in the number of students attending our university. Although the current tables seat six students each, they make poor use of the available floor space. The cubicles, on the other hand, are designed for maximum space efficiency, and the library can therefore add 50 new seats.

<-NARRATOR:-> Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> They're making a mistake.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> What do you mean?
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Look, they're trying to do away with distractions.
So we can study better. But with this change,
we won't have anywhere in the library to get together to work on group projects.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> True. Group project work is common these days.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> So instead of buying these new units,
they should use the money to build meeting rooms ... and that would reduce any noise in the main library areas.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah. That's what we could really use.
There's just not as much need to work in isolation.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Exactly. And the other thing is, what's this about overcrowding?
Sure, we have more students enrolled at the university this year, but
do we really have a problem with overcrowding?
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> I don't think so. I always get a whole table to myself.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Right, I see empty tables there all the time.
It'll just be a waste of money to replace what we have, since what we have now is sufficient for the amount of students that use the library.
