Personally, I would like to shop in large grocery stores and department stores rather than small shop. I feel this way for 2 reasons.

First off, there are many products that could be chosen. For example, I like to cook by myself, so if there are more ingredients in the store, I could choose many dishes I want.

Secondly, general quality of most products would be better in large department store. For instance, I used to buy things in a small shop until I found that their meats were not fresh compared to some department stores'. And if I buy some broken products, I could have a better refund mechanism in department stores.
