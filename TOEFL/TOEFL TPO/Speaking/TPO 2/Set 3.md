In the reading material, the university is planning to eliminate its bus service because few students ride them, the service is expensive to operate, and the saved money can expand the parking lots.

However, the student disagree the school's proposal for two reasons. First off, the bus's route only go through the areas that is too expensive to live for students, and thus the reason cause the low number of students riding them. He suppose that the university should alter the route rather than eliminate whole bus service.

Another reason is that adding more parking lots, in other words, encourage the students to drive. This will cause more noise and traffic in campus. And, more and more parking lots are hence required.

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to two students discussing the article.
MALE STUDENT: I don't like the university's plan.
FEMALE STUDENT: Really? I've ridden those buses, and sometimes there were only a few people on the bus.
It did seem like kind of a waste.
MALE STUDENT: I see your point. But I think the problem is the *route's out-of-date.*
It *only goes through the neighborhoods that've gotten too expensive for students to live in.*
It's ridiculous that they haven't already changed the route-
you know, so it goes where most off-campus students live now.
I bet if they did that they'd get plenty of students riding those buses.
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, at least they're adding more parking.
It's gotten really tough to find a space.
MALE STUDENT: That's the other part I don't like, actually.
Cutting back the bus service and *adding parking's just gonna encourage more students to drive on campus*.
And that'll just *add to the noise around campus and create more traffic*...
and that'll increase the need for more parking spaces...
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, I guess I can see your point.
Maybe it would be better if more students used the buses instead of driving.
MALE STUDENT: Right. And the university should make it easier to do that, not harder.

## Passage
The university has decided to discontinue its free bus service for students. The reason given for this decision is that few students ride the buses and the buses are expensive to operate. Currently, the buses run from the center of campus past university buildings and through some of the neighborhoods surrounding the campus. The money saved by eliminating the bus service will be used to expand the overcrowded student parking lots.
