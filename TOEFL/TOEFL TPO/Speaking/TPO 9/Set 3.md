## Notes

## Content
According to the letter, a student proposes that the location of displaying painting should be the lobby at the entrance to the student center because many students pass through the place every day and there is enough natural light from the glass window. However, the student, she, disagrees with this idea for 2 reasons.

First, she feels that many people passing through makes those painting hard to be appreciated. It is because that even when you want to look at a painting, many people will go through your front and disrupt the concentration.

Secondly, about the natural light, she thinks that nature light isn't the best light source to lighten paintings because natural light could be too bright when sunny and too dark when cloudy. Thus, she feels that consistent light such that used in art museums should be appropriate.

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
MALE STUDENT: Mary, you are an art student.
What do you think of this letter?
FEMALE STUDENT: I don't like the idea.
MALE STUDENT: Why not?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, first of all … his first point about a lot people passing through the student center, that's true, but…
MALE STUDENT: But?
FEMALE STUDENT: But it's always really crowded with people coming and going.
It's not good for showing artwork.
Imagine you are standing there, trying to look at a painting.
There's gonna be like a million people walking through, people walking in front of you, blocking your view, distracting you…
MALE STUDENT: Hm…yeah…hadn't thought of that.
FEMALE STUDENT: You won't be able to appreciate the artwork, or get a good look at anything with so much going on, with so many people moving around.
MALE STUDENT: Yeah, I see what you mean.
MALE STUDENT: Plus, he's wrong about the windows.
MALE STUDENT: But isn't it true that it's good for art to have lots of light?
FEMALE STUDENT: In a sense, yeah, but that kind of light, all that natural light from windows?
That's actually not good because if it's really sunny out, it'll be way too bright.
If it's cloudy, it'll be way too dark.
MALE STUDENT: Oh!
FEMALE STUDENT: What you want is controlled light, consistent light, the kind you get from electric light bulbs.
Think about in an art museum.
In an art museum, you've got electric lighting, and the light is always carefully controlled, always at the same level.

## Student Art Display
The university is currently considering possible locations on campus for displaying paintings and other artwork by students. I think the lobby at the entrance to the student center would be a great location. Since many students pass through the student center every day, artwork displayed in the lobby would be viewed by hundreds of people . Also, because the whole front of the building is made of glass windows, the lobby is filled with natural light. This makes it perfect for displaying artwork, which should have plenty of light to be seen and appreciated.

Sincerely,
Paul Sands
