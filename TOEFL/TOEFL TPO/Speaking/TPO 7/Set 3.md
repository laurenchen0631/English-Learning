## Content
According to the newspaper, the university plans to eliminate the sculpture program because the stus major in art lack interests in sculpture and there is no budget to hire a new professor. However, the student, she, disagrees with the school's decision for two reasons.

First of all, the students major in art doesn't lack of interests in sculpture. They doesn't enroll sculpture program since it is optional and there are other requirements like painting and drawing to occupy their schedule. She thinks that the school should adjusts the requirements rather eliminating the class.

Another reason about the budget is true. However, she feels that school can hire a part-time professor. Furthermore, there are actually some professors who have secondary fields in the art department. Some of them are good sculptors and can teach the sculpture class.

## Vocab

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to two students discussing the article.
MALE STUDENT: Everything all right?
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, I'm just upset about that article I showed you this morning.
MALE STUDENT: Why?What's the big deal?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, as an art major, I think it's a big loss for the department.
The university's got it all wrong.
MALE STUDENT: What do you mean?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, the low enrollment isn't because art majors don't want to take these classes.
Problem is: who has time to take them when there are so many other requirements.
MALE STUDENT: I...I don't understand.
FEMALE STUDENT: See, the classes they are eliminating are all optional.
The required courses are mostly painting and drawing and they take up all our time.
What we really need are different requirements.
Then art majors could take a better variety of classes, all the things we are interested in.
MALE STUDENT: That makes sense.
But, the thing about the professor.
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, that's true.
But still, they are being drastic.
If money is the problem, they could hire a part-time professor, or, most of the professors in the department have secondary fields...
MALE STUDENT: Really?
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah.
At least a few painting teachers are also great sculptors.
I'm sure one of them could teach a class.

## Passage
University administrators announced yesterday that the sculpture program, a division of the art department, will be eliminated. "The main reason is a lack of student interest," reported one administrator. "Although the number of art students has increased, fewer and fewer art majors are taking sculpture classes." Furthermore, the department's only sculpture professor is retiring this year. "Given the art department's limited budget," the administrator explained, "it just doesn't make sense to hire a new full-time professor to teach sculpture for only a handful of students."
