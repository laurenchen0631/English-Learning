## Content
In my opinion, learning through online courses is better than learning in the traditional classroom. I feel this way for 2 reasons.

First off, there are lots of people to help each other. For example, in online course website, like Coursera or Udemy, there are usually an area in which people raise their questions. And many enthusiastic users may help you to solve your doubts without waiting for the resolution of the lecturer.

Secondly, time arrangement is more convenient. In traditional class, if you miss a class, you might have to ask other classmates about the content of the class. In contrast, for online courses, if you have some urgent incidence that day, you can choose another time to watch the courses and prepare assignments.
