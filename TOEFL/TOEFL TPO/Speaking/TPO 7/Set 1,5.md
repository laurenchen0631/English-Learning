## Set 1 Topic 
If friends from another country were going to spend time in your country, what city or place would you suggest they visit? Using details and examples, explain why.

## Set 1 Response
I would suggest my friend to come to (city) for two reasons,
First of all, (city) is my hometown, I spend 20 years living here so I can take my friends to those must-go spots easily
For example, Mike is my friend that I met 2 years ago when I was studying in (country) as an exchange student, He came to visit me this summer. I took him to the local museum which boasts one of the best collections in Asia. He was so impressed by the exquisite antiques and said it worth coming just to see the museum.

Another reason is, food here in (city) is without doubt, superb! A saying in my country goes - there is no enjoyable travel without delicacy~ I can guarantee that local dishes are all must-try if you visit my country.

## Set 5 Listening
NARRATOR: Now listen to a conversation between two students.
MALE STUDENT: Hey Jennifer, how are things going?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, I'm relieved it's the end of the semester but, that's actually part of my problem
MALE STUDENT: What do you mean?
FEMALE STUDENT: Can you believe this—
My computer broke yesterday, so it's at the shop being repaired.
It won't be ready until the end of next week, which is when all my papers are due.
MALE STUDENT: Why not use the computer lab?
They've got lots of machines there.
FEMALE STUDENT: I know.
But it gets so noisy there that I can't keep my mind on my work.
I mean when I'm at the computer, I'm not just typing - I'm thinking!
So I need quiet to concentrate.
MALE STUDENT: Maybe you could try going in the morning or evening. It might be less noisy then!
FEMALE STUDENT: Maybe, but this time of year everybody is working on papers and it could be crowded even then.
MALE STUDENT: Um...what about calling back the computer repair shop to see if they can have your computer ready at the beginning of next week instead?
That would still give you enough time to finish your papers by the end of the week.
FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, I hadn’t thought of that.
The only problem is that the shop is closed today and tomorrow for the long holiday weekend so it would be a few days before I could talk to them.
