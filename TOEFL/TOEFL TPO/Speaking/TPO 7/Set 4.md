## Notes

## Content
The passage introduces the concept of behavior modification, which means behavior changes based on the possible consequence of people's actions. The professor illustrates that point with the example of the kids who are starting to go to schools. 

At first, they don't known what is a proper behavior. Thus, they interrupt the teacher, and walk around the classroom when they should not. And then, the teach begins to be angry and punish them by not allowing them to go to outside and play. Afterwards, they learn that the misbehaving gets them in trouble and cease to do so. 

On the other hand, they learn that good behaviors, like sitting quietly in the classroom, will be rewarded. The teacher may put some happy-face stickers on their homework. Finally, due to the kind reaction of the teacher, the kids will keep the good behaviors *over and over*.

## Vocab

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to part of lecture on the topic in a psychology class.
MALE PROFESSOR: This happens all the time with kids in schools.
Say there is a little boy or a girl who's just starting school.
Well, they are not really used to the rules about proper behavior for a classroom.
So at the beginning, they might, I don't know, interrupt the teacher, walk around the classroom when they are supposed to be sitting down, you know just misbehaving in general.
OK, but what happens?
Well, the teacher gets angry with them when they act this way.
They might get punished.
They have to sit at their desks when everyone else is allowed to go outside and play, and they certainly don't like that.
Soon they'll learn that this kind of behavior gets them in trouble.
They'll also learn that when they raise their hand to talk to the teacher and sit quietly and pay attention during class, they are rewarded.
The teacher tells them she is proud of them, and maybe puts little happy face stickers on their homework.
Now that their behavior gets a good reaction from the teacher, the kids learn to always act this way in class and not behave the way they used to.

## Passage
Individuals often modify their behavior based on what they have learned about the possible consequences of their actions When an individual learns through experience that a certain behavior results in pleasant consequences, that behavior is likely to be repeated. An unpleasant consequence, on the other hand, discourages further repetition of the behavior. While behavior modification can be observed in experiments, it also occurs frequently in everyday settings, when individuals change their behavior based on what they have learned about the consequences of that behavior.

## Topic
Using the example from the lecture, explain what behavior modification is and how it works.
