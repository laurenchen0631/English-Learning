## Content
The passage introduces the concept of Choice-Supportive Bias which means a tendency to focus on and remember only the advantages of the selected option. The professor illustrates the idea with the example of his friend.

At first, he helped his friend to select which house he buy. Then, he find a good place which had a great location that is close to the place where he work. However, there is an disadvantage: the house is smaller than he expected. Eventually, the friend still bought the house. After a few years, the professor asked why he bought the house. The friend said that "because of the location", and professor then asked about the size. Surprisingly, the friend behaved like he never had this idea before.

## Choice-Supportive Bias
People often make decisions by considering the advantages and disadvantages of each option. However, after a person selects an option, there is a tendency for that person to exhibit the choice-supportive bias. After selecting an option, a person may begin to favor that option. Without being fully aware of it, people who exhibit this bias tend to focus on and remember only the advantages of the option they selected. As time passes, they will overlook the option's disadvantages, eventually even forgetting them.

## Lecture
<-NARRATOR:-> Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a psychology class.
<-MALE PROFESSOR:-> OK, so an example of this from my own life.
Five or six years ago, I was helping a friend of mine decide on a house to buy.
He had been in the market to buy a house, and he had it narrowed down to this one house that he was interested in.
What he really liked about this house was...
it had an excellent location.
It was in a great place
that was actually in the same part of town where he was working-
right up the street from his job
-so he wouldn't have far to drive to get to work,
which he really liked.
However, the downside of this house was that it was smaller than what he was hoping to buy.
He had wanted to buy sort of a big house, and
this house just wasn't that big.
So, it was a tough decision,
but my friend eventually did decide to buy the house.
And a few years after he made the purchase, I remember, we were talking about the decision and why he decided to buy the house.
He told me, well, of course, it was because of the house's location.
He told me how happy he was with the fact that it was so close to his work...
how great it was that it was only a few minutes from his job.
I said, yes, but
what about its size-do you still think the house is kind of small?
And he looked at me
kind of surprised"Small?
What do you mean, small?"
-like he didn't know what I was talking about.
The house's size, a couple years after buying it,
just didn't seem to be on his mind anymore.
