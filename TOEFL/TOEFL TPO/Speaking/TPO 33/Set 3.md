According to the letter, a student proposes that schools should provide an Airport Bus for School Breaks because there is no other public transportation and buses running between campus buildings can be used. Furthermore, the man agree with the proposal for 2 reasons.

First, that will be less expensive for students. Because the school is outside of the city, if there is no another can ride, they must take a taxi whose price are relatively high for students.

Secondly, there is no such need for bus service in campus during breaks. At the period, most of students already leave the campus, and thus running buses only between campus building is not useful. It can be shifted to provide a ride to the airport. 

## An Airport Bus for School Breaks
Students who fly home for the winter and spring breaks need to get to and from the airport, which is a half-hour drive from campus. I think the university should run a free bus service for students between campus and the airport during the breaks. This would help the students, since there is no public transportation between campus and the airport. In order to provide service to the airport, some of the buses that normally run between campus buildings when classes are in session could run between the school and the airport during the school breaks.
Sincerely,

## [Lecture]()
<-NARRATOR:-> Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Did you see this, Jim?
What do you think about her idea?
<-MALE STUDENT:-> I think it'd be great.
It'd make things much less expensive.
'Cause our campus is located outside the city,
if you can't get a friend with a car to give you a ride... there's no other way to get to the airport...
and your only choice is to take a taxi.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> I know. I've had to take a taxi before, and it's pretty expensive.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, like thirty or forty dollars, which is a lot, especially for students.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, definitely.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> [transitioning] And I think it would work, what she's suggesting...
I mean, there's less need for buses on campus during that time, to take students between the buildings.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> You mean because classes are over then?
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, exactly... there might be some final exams still going on,
but regular classes won't be meeting.
There are much fewer students left on campus, and they don't need to get around campus that often.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, I guess they're just making occasional trips to take exams or go to the library or gym or whatever.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Right.It shouldn't cause any problem for anyone who still needs to get around campus.
