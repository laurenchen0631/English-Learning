Personally, I think that it's unnecessary to learn to play a musical instrument in education. I feel this way for two reasons. 

First off, there are other ways cultivate the ability to appreciate musics. For example, teachers can play some classical music or play some videos of opera like Remieo&Juliet or Cats. Put simply, playing a instrument is not an only effective way to learn musics.

Secondly, some instruments cannot be afforded by some poor person. For instance, I knew a gut at junior high school, he could barely pay his tuition. After a few months, he finally had the money to buy the instrument for the class.
