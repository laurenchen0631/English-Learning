2. Campus Dining club at last week of each semester 
3. give valuable experience to help --> cooking for more people practice
4. charge additional --> fancy restaurant, cheaper than going out

## Content
According to the article, the university intends to transform the dining service into The Campus Dinging Club for one week at the end of each semester. Additionally, the student supports this decision for two reasons.

First off, this is a valuable experience to those students who are studying cook. Taking his cousin for example, he was in the program and felt that it's more difficult to cook for lots of people than for classmates. Because there is more pressure and more people waiting, it might be easy to make a mistake which makes it a good practice.

Secondly, there will be some fantastic meals but with cheaper price than going out to a fancy restaurant in town. And also, the meal might be as good as those in the restaurants.

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to two students discussing the article.
FEMALE STUDENT: Did you see that article?
MALE STUDENT:Yeah—and it sounds like a great idea.
It's really good for the students in that program.
FEMALE STUDENT: Don't they cook in class anyway?
MALE STUDENT: Well, yeah, they do…
But *my cousin was in the program* a few years ago, and she said that *it's very different to cook for a lot people in that kind of atmosphere than to cook for classmates*.
FEMALE STUDENT: Why is that?
MALE STUDENT: Well, in class, you can take your time, but cooking for more people *there is more pressure*.
I mean you are in a rush, *people are waiting, and it might be easy to make a mistake* with all that stress.
FEMALE STUDENT: Then they'll think you are a bad chef right?
MALE STUDENT: Absolutely.
FEMALE STUDENT: So, OK, its *good practice.*
But what about the extra cost?
MALE STUDENT: Well, look at it this way.
You've eaten at some of the *fancier restaurants in town* right?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, there are some great places to eat around here.
MALE STUDENT: Well, these students...*they'll be making fantastic meals and it's gonna be cheaper than going out to one of those restaurants.*
FEMALE STUDENT: Much cheaper actually.
MALE STUDENT: So, you know, it would be worth it.
*The meal will be as good as the ones in those expensive restaurants.*

## Passage
Starting this year, *the university dining hall will be transformed into The Campus Dining Club for one week at the end of each semester*. During the last week of each semester, the dining hall will feature special meals prepared by the university's culinary arts students. The school feels that this will *give students who are studying cooking and food preparation valuable experience that will help them later*, when they pursue careers. The university has announced that it will *charge a small additional fee* for these dinners in order to pay for the special gourmet food ingredients that will be required.
