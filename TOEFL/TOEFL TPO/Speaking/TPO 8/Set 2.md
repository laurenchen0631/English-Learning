In my opinion, I believe that taking risks and *adventure* are better than being conservative. I feel this way for 2 reasons.

First off, trying new things can improve the efficiency. Taking modern technology for example, a lot of convenient tools, such as automatic drawing program by artificial intelligence, spring up like mushrooms. If you are willing to try these new things, they may hugely increase your work efficiency.

Secondly, challenges is a way that help people to earn more. For example, if a person live in a town in which traditional industries are prevalent, the unadventurous person would not have any chance to realize other high-tech industries in other places of the world. He will lose the opportunity of earning more money since he doesn't like to take any adventure.
