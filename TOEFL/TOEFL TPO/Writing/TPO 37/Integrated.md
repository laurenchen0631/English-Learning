## Essay
The reading and the lecture are both about effectiveness of turtle excluder device. The author of the reading feels that TED has some significant disadvantages, whereas the lecturer challenges the claims made by the author. In short, she is of the opinion that TED is still a effective tool even thought some problems actually exist.

To begin with, the author contends that turtles are seldom captured by the shrimpers' nets, which usually happen once a month. The article mentions that compared to the cost of endangering a few of turtles the cost of losing a certain percentage of shrimp is higher. The specific argument is challenged by the lecturer who claims that in total there would be thousands of sea turtles caught by shrimpers. Additionally, she says that the lost of shrimps is more minute than the death of thousands of sea turtles .

Secondly, the writer suggests that alternative methods exist and work more effectively. In the article, it is said that it is a way that reducing the time limit that shrimp boats keep their nets underwater. The lecturer, however, rebuts this by remarking that those alternative could benefit only in theory. Furthermore, she elaborates on this by bringing the point that for shortening the period of nets underwater a practicable way to regulate the time limit doesn't exist since even government can not supervise all behaviors on the sea.

Finally, the author posits that TEDs are useless for some large breed of turtles. Moreover, it is stated in the article that the passage on the nets are not so large that some turtles are still stuck inside. In contrast, the lecturer's position is that small-sized TEDs are enough for some regions. She notes that the design of TEDs are able to modify to fit the size of local species.

## Review
The reading and the lecture are both about effectiveness of turtle excluder *devices*. The author of the reading feels that TED has some significant disadvantages, whereas the lecturer challenges the claims made by the author. In short, she is of the opinion that TED is still a effective tool even *though* some problems actually exist.

To begin with, the author contends that turtles are seldom captured by the shrimpers' nets, which usually happen once a month. The article mentions that compared to the cost of endangering a few of turtles the cost of losing a certain percentage of shrimp is higher. The specific argument is challenged by the lecturer who claims that in total there would be thousands of sea turtles caught by shrimpers. Additionally, she says that *the population of sea turtles are so small that the death of thousands of sea turtles collectively indicates a huge loss when comparing to shrimpers' decline of revenue.*

Secondly, the writer suggests that alternative methods exist and work more effectively. In the article, it is said that it is a way that reducing the time limit that shrimp boats keep their nets underwater. The lecturer, however, rebuts this by remarking that those alternative could benefit only in theory. Furthermore, she elaborates on this by bringing the point that, for shortening the period of nets underwater, a practicable way to regulate the time limit doesn't exist since even government can not supervise *their* behaviors on the sea.

Finally, the author posits that TEDs are useless for some large breed of turtles. Moreover, it is stated in the article that the passage on the nets are not so large that some turtles are still stuck inside. In contrast, the lecturer's position is that small-sized TEDs are enough for some regions. She notes that the design of TEDs are able to modify to fit the size of *the* local species.

## Reading
One of the threats to endangered sea turtle species is the use of nets by commercial shrimp-fishing boats. When turtles get accidentally caught in the nets, they cannot rise to the surface of the ocean to breathe, and they die. Some people suggest that this problem can be solved through an invention called a turtle excluder device (TED) that is incorporated into the nets. A TED provides a passage through which the turtles can escape. However, TEDs have been criticized for several reasons.

First, some shrimpers (shrimp fishers) argue that turtles get trapped only rarely: it is estimated that on average, one shrimp boat accidentally catches about one turtle every month. On the other hand, using TEDs costs the shrimpers some of their catch. Every time the shrimpers cast the nets, a certain percentage of shrimp manage to escape through the turtle passages. The shrimpers complain that the cost of losing shrimp on a daily basis is too high in comparison with the small chance of saving one turtle.

Second, there are alternative methods of protecting sea turtles that may be more effective than TEDs. One method that can be used is shortening the time limit that shrimp boats are allowed to keep their nets underwater. When the time limit is reached, the nets have to be pulled up to the surface, allowing any turtles caught in the net to get air and also giving shrimpers the opportunity to release the turtles from the nets.

Third, TEDs are not effective for larger species of endangered sea turtles. Some species like loggerhead and leatherback turtles can grow to be quite large and cannot fit through the escape passage that standard TEDs provide. Such turtles cannot escape from the nets even if the nets are equipped with TEDs.

## Lecture
Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about. 

Many experts believe that turtle excluder devices, also known as TEDs, are a very good way to protect endangered turtles, and that they should be a vital part of the equipment on any shrimp boat. Here are their responses to the criticisms that you just read about.

First, it’s true that catching a turtle is a rare thing for any one boat. However, there are, for example, thousands of shrimp boats operating off the southern coast of the United States. **Collectively these shrimpers accidentally catch thousands of turtles every year.** And these are endangered sea turtles whose populations are already too small, so harming several thousand every year is a big problem. So when considering the impact of TEDs, don’t think in terms of an individual shrimper losing a few shrimp, but **rather in terms of how the sea turtle population as a whole is affected by the shrimp industry as a whole.**

Second, implementing time limits to ensure that the turtles are brought up for air in time—that sounds like a good idea, but only in theory. The problem is that the time limits **are almost impossible to enforce**. There’re thousands of shrimp boats far out at sea, and **government patrol boats cannot really monitor the time limits all these boats use.** The use of TEDs is easier to enforce: all that’s required is checking the shrimp boats before they leave port and making sure their nets have TEDs.

Third, it’s true that TEDs can be too small for some very large species of turtle. **But in the areas where they’re needed, it’s not a problem to create TEDs that are somewhat larger**. The design of the TED can be modified easily without affecting the way that it functions. So once larger TEDs begin to be produced, this will no longer be a problem.
