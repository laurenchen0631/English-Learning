## Essay
While some people believes that keeping the old friends is more significant than acquiring new ones, as far as I am concerned, I disagree with the opinion. My arguments for this point are listed as follows.

First of all, a beneficent relation takes massive time to cultivate. Getting acquainted with new friends is so easy that it can happen at many different situation, such as in a dancing party, in a nightclub, or on social network. However, every person has different definition of "friend" which is likely to be a person that you recently interact with or that you know a lot about. For instance, I sometimes acquaint someone new by dating applications. Notwithstanding I am fond of talking to unknown men who attracts my interests, I won't recognize them as my friend at that moment. Most of them will dissolve from my memory for the reason that I spent relatively little time with them. In the other hand, a few of them who I got along for longer period become a friend that take up some area in my recollection.

Secondly, old friends realize you deeper. Those long-term friends about who you often care are more willing to appease your distress even if you don't ask any assistance from them. Taking my intimate as example, we have been familiar with each other since we were in junior high school. At the period of deciding our future college and major, I extremely hesitated about what I should choose for the future and my enthusiasm. That intimate was the first one who perceived my anxiety even earlier than the teacher and my parents who thought I was such an intelligent child that I can definitely determine my future. He accompanied with me to assess advantages and disadvantages of various colleges and faculties in terms of my propensity regardless of the situation that we were preparing the exams. I am still gratifying his altruistic behavior up to now. 

To sum up, people should keep their old friends as much as they can. Inasmuch as not only nourishing a good relationship takes considerable time but also old friends are more possible to aid you without any recompense whatever the situation is, maintaining a perpetual relationship is more consequential than attaining new friends.
