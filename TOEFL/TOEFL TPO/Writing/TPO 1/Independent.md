## Essay
Some people argues, as if it is a universal truth, that sports and social activities is less significant than classes and libraries. But to be frank, I don't agree with them. There are mainly two reasons why I hold confidence on the topic statement, which I will explore in the following essay. First, social activities are the best routine to apply the learned knowledge. Second, everyone has unique characteristic and propensity.

To begin with, social activities provide a way to use something taught in classes. In other words, they relatively foster further the ability of applying learned knowledge rather than as metaphysics. Unless the students have chances to adapt those theory or wisdom by themselves, they would never realize those intelligence and how to practice them. Taking my experience as a example, I majored in computer science and I learned a vast array of essential knowledge about programming. I could accomplish those kinds of assignments very well, but however I didn't know which situation in real software industry those knowledge can be used until my first internship. I went about developing a new website. Eventually, after I finished the project, I realized that the limitation of what I had learned, not to mention another applicability I had not been aware.

Secondly, the institutions should not discriminate against those prefer sports and social activities on account of everyone's unique characteristic and propensity. Both the non-educational activities and educational hardware, such as classes, professor or libraries, are an investment to the students, also, for schools. Schools are as companies whose ultimate purpose is to earn profit; therefore, it seems risky to put all their finance in educational basket. Additionally, due to the disparate capacity, it is nonsensical that sports and social activities only deplete the limited resource of schools. For instance, a few years ago I met a person, who major in the Chinese faculty, in the cooking club of the university. It is amazing that he made every dishes with his full attention. At that time, he told me that his family was operating a small restaurant which didn't make an appreciable buck and that he desired to refine the restaurant. Until 6 months ago, I watched his presence on a TV show which introduces the sensational restaurants; and what is more, he attributed his achievements to the club and the university. While this kind of behavior, no doubt, is humility, it still is a positive promotion which could boost the impending number of enrollment by its reputation, which raise revenue of the university.

From the above you might got the idea that I agree that sports and social activities should be treated with equal support and same emphasis as classes and libraries. Inasmuch as social activities help students to practice what they have learned, and sports and club also enhance renown and profit, I agree with that the treatment between should be impartial.
