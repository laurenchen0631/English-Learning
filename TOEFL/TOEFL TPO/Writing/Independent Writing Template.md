* How to write
	1. Outlining
		* To begin with, you should write a "main point" which is your answer to the question posed by the exam.
		* Then, think two "reasons" that support the main point. These are broad and not too specific. However, they must be unique.
		* Below each of the reasons. you should write at least two "details". These are more specific. They support the reasons and explain why they have cited the reasons.  They might also include examples from the student’s life that support the reasons.
		* The four or five paragraph structure is:
			1. Introductory Paragraph
			2. Body Paragraph 1
			3. Body Paragraph 2
			4. (Optional) Body Paragraph 3
			5. Concluding Paragraph
	2. Writing an Introduction
		1. Sentence one: A “hook.” This is an **interesting sentence that comes before your main point**. It **references the question and draws your reader** into the essay.
		1. Sentence two: Your **main point**. In one good, clear sentence state your main point. **Don’t be too long**.  Get to the point!
		1. Sentence three: A transitional sentence. Try something like “I feel this way for two reasons."
		1. Sentence four:  A one sentence **summary of your first reason**. Begin this sentence with “first” (you can leave this out if you are low on time).
		1. Sentence five:  A one sentence **summary of your second reason**. Begin this sentence with “second” (you can leave this out if you are low on time).
	3. Writing a body paragraph
		1. Each reason gets its own paragraph. Don't combine your reasons into one paragraph.
		1. Start your first paragraph with a transitional word or phrase like “first,” “to begin with,” and your second paragraph with “second" or "secondly."
		1. **At the beginning of each body paragraph, clearly state your reason. Don't use a hook**, just get to the point. Next, **state your details one after another, expanding each one to three or four sentences**.  You can **expand by including a personal example** from your life. ([1]A Topic Sentence, [2-4]The Explanation, [5]The Transition, [6-]The Personal Example)
	4. Writing a conclusion
		1. Sentence one: **re-state your main point** and begin with a phrase like “to sum it up…”
		1. Sentence two: **restate your two reasons**, beginning with a transitional phrase like “this is because…”
		1. Sentence three: Once again, **restate your main point but use different words**
		
* Examples:
	1. 
	There are many great gifts that can be given to a child. I believe that the best gift to give a child is a pet.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.  First, a pet can be very educational.  Second, a pet can be a good friend to a young child. 

	To begin with, a pet is a very educational gift.  Having a pet teaches children responsibility.  A pet has to be fed every day and be given a chance to exercise.  The owner of a pet also has to observe the health of their pet and take action if it becomes sick.  Practicing this kind of responsibility will make a child more mature.  Moreover, a pet can help teach a child about the stages of life.  Animals grow much faster than humans and a young child can learn a lot by observing how their pet grows up.  I had a pet gecko as a child and watching it grow from a baby to a full-sized adult taught me a lot and got me very interested in biology and nature.

	Secondly, I feel that a pet makes great friend.   It is good for children to have pets because they are never judgmental.  A child might have a bad day at school or he might get in a fight with his friends, but he will never fight with his pet.  It will love him unconditionally.  Furthermore, pets can prevent children from being lonely.  These days parents are often too busy to spend time with their children.  They often leave their kids home alone.  This might leave some kids feeling lonely, but those with pets will never feel alone.

	To sum it up, I feel that a pet is the very best gift to give to a child. This is because pets are very educational, and they make great friends. There really is no better gift that a child can receive than a pet.

	There are many different learning styles, and it is important that we look for classes that match our academic preferences. **Personally, I believe that** it is extremely beneficial to take classes which are very interactive. **I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay**.

	**First of all,** classes that include a lot of discussions develop our communication skills. Our long-term success depends on our ability to persuade others to accept our ideas and proposals, so it critically important to seize opportunities to talk to a variety of people. If we do not practice this skill, we will never develop it. **My personal experience is a compelling example of this.** About ten years ago, I enrolled in a history class. At that time I had already taken many classes at university, but I was still very shy around strangers. However, after nine months of participating in debates, discussions and presentations in that class I came out of my shell and became a very confident public speaker. As a result, when I began my career following my graduation I excelled in group work and was seen by my supervisors as a natural leader. For this reason, I was quickly promoted within my company. I have been very successful at my workplace, and I owe it all to that wonderful class.

	**Secondly,** classes that are very interactive help us to form connections with our classmates, and these can lead to future opportunities.  When we regularly converse with our peers, we get to know their personalities. **Consequently**, we can even become very close friends with them. In contrast, when students just sit and passively listen to their professor, they are unlikely to get to know each other. **For instance,** when my brother was in college he took an information technology class that required a lot of group work. He spent two months that semester working on a programming project with two other students and during that time they all became very close. In fact, a year later they felt comfortable enough to actually form a company together. It has been six years since they founded that business and it is still very profitable.

	**In conclusion**, **I am of the opinion that** it is a great idea to take classes where students actually talk to each other and their professor. **This is because** they help us develop valuable skills and abilities, **and** because they help us form important social connections.
