## History

In Britain one of the most dramatic changes of the Industrial Revolution was the harnessing of power. Until the reign of George ?(1760-1820), available sources of power for work and travel had not increased since the Middle Ages. There were three sources of power: animal or human muscles; the wind, operating on sail or windmill; and running water. **"Only the last of these was suited at all to the continuous operating of machines, and although waterpower *abounded* in Lancashire and Scotland and ran grain mills as well as textile mills, it had one great disadvantage: streams flowed where nature intended them to, and water-driven factories had to be located on their banks whether or not the location was desirable for other reasons."** Furthermore, even the most reliable waterpower varied with the seasons and disappeared in a drought. The new age of machinery, in short, could not have been born without a new source of both movable and constant power.

The source had long been known but not "**exploited**". Early in the eighteenth century, a pump had come into use in which expanding steam raised a *piston* in a cylinder, and atmospheric pressure brought it down again when the steam condensed inside the cylinder to form a vacuum. This ""atmospheric engine"," invented by Thomas Savery and **vastly** improved by his partner, Thomas Newcomen, *embodied* revolutionary principles, but it was so slow and wasteful of fuel that it could not be employed outside the coal mines for which it had been designed. In the 1760s, James Watt perfected a separate condenser for the steam, so that the cylinder did not have to be cooled at every *stroke*; then he devised a way to make the piston turn a wheel and thus convert reciprocating (back and forth) motion into rotary motion. He *thereby* transformed an inefficient pump of limited use into a steam engine of a thousand uses. The final step came when steam was introduced into the cylinder to drive the piston backward as well as forward, thereby increasing the speed of the engine and cutting its fuel consumption.

Watt's steam engine soon showed what it could do. It liberated industry from dependence on running water. The engine eliminated water in the mines by driving efficient pumps, which made possible deeper and deeper mining. The ready availability of coal inspired William Murdoch during the 1790s to develop the first new form of nighttime illumination to be discovered *in a millennium and a half.* Coal gas rivaled smoky oil lamps and *flickering* candles, and early in the new century, *well-to-do* Londoners "grew accustomed to" gaslit houses and even streets. Iron manufacturers, which had starved for fuel while depending on charcoal, also benefited from ever-increasing supplies of coal: *blast* *furnaces* with steam-powered *bellows* turned out more iron and steel for the new machinery. Steam became the motive force of the Industrial Revolution as coal and iron ore were the raw materials.

By 1800 more than a thousand steam engines were in use in the British *Isles*, and Britain "**retained**" a *virtual* monopoly on steam engine production until the 1830s. Steam power did not merely *spin* cotton and *roll* iron; early in the new century, it also multiplied ten times over the amount of paper that a single worker could produce in a day. At the same time, operators of the first printing presses run by steam rather than by hand found it possible to produce a thousand pages in an hour rather than thirty. Steam also promised to eliminate a transportation problem not fully solved by either *canal boats* or *turnpikes*. Boats could carry heavy weights, but canals could not cross hilly terrain; turnpikes could cross the hills, but the *roadbeds* could not stand up under great weights. These problems needed still another solution, and *the ingredients for it lay close at hand.* In some industrial regions, heavily laden *wagons*, with *flanged* wheels, were being hauled by horses along metal rails; and the stationary steam engine was *puffing* in the factory and mine. Another generation passed before inventors succeeded in combining these ingredients, by putting the engine on wheels and the wheels on the rails, so as to provide a machine to take the place of the horse. Thus the railroad age *sprang* from what had already happened in the eighteenth century.

## Questions
1. Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the **highlighted sentence** in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information．
	1. Running water was the best power source for factories since it could keep machines operating continuously, but since it was abundant only in Lancashire and Scotland, most mills and factories that were located elsewhere could not be water driven.
	1. The disadvantage of using waterpower is that streams do not necessarily flow in places that are the most suitable for factories, which explains why so many water-powered grain and textile mills were located in undesirable places.
	1. Since machines could be operated continuously only where running water was abundant, grain and textile mills, as well as other factories, tended to be located only in Lancashire and Scotlan1.
