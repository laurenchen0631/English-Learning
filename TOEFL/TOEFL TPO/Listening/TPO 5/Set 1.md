NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between a student and a counselor at the University Counseling Center.

FEMALE STUDENT: Hi, thanks for seeing me *on such short notice*.

MALE COUNSELOR: No problem. How can I help?

FEMALE STUDENT: Well, I think I might have made a mistake coming to the school.

MALE COUNSELOR: What makes you say that?

FEMALE STUDENT: I'm a little *overwhelmed* by the size of this place.I come from a small town. There were only 75 of us in my high school graduating class. Everyone knew everyone, we all grew up together.

MALE COUNSELOR: So it's a bit of a culture shock for you, being one of 15,000 students on a big campus in an unfamiliar city?

FEMALE STUDENT: That's an *understatement*. I just can't get comfortable in class or in the dorms. You know, socially.

MALE COUNSELOR: Um... well, let's start with the academics. Tell me about your classes.

FEMALE STUDENT: I'm taking mostly introductory courses and some are taught in these huge lecture halls.

MALE COUNSELOR: And you are having trouble in keeping pace with the material?

FEMALE STUDENT: No, in fact *I got an A* on my first economics paper. It's just that, it's so impersonal, I'm not used to it.

MALE COUNSELOR: Are all your classes impersonal?

FEMALE STUDENT: No, it's just that, for example, in sociology yesterday, the professor asked a question, so I raised my hand, several of us raised our hands. And I kept my hand up because I did the reading and knew the answer. But the professor just answered his own question and continued with the lecture.

MALE COUNSELOR: Well, in a big room it's possible he didn't notice you. Maybe he was trying to save time. In either case I wouldn't take it personally.

FEMALE STUDENT: I suppose. But I just don't know how to, you know, distinguish myself.

MALE COUNSELOR: Why not stop by his office during office hours?

FEMALE STUDENT: That wouldn't seem right. You know, *taking time from other students who need help*?

MALE COUNSELOR: Don't say that. That's what office hours are for. There is no reason you couldn't pop in to say hi and to make yourself known. If you are learning a lot in class, let the professor know. Wouldn't you appreciate positive feedback if you were a professor?

FEMALE STUDENT: You are right. That's a good idea.

MALE COUNSELOR: OK, er... let's turn to your social life. How's it going in the dorms?

FEMALE STUDENT: I don't have much in common with my roommate or anyone else I've met so far. Everyone's into sports and I'm more *artsy*, you know, into music. I play the *cello*.

MALE COUNSELOR: Hah, have you been playing long?

FEMALE STUDENT: Since age ten. It's a big part of my life. At home I was the youngest member of our community orchestra.

MALE COUNSELOR: You are not going to believe this.There is a *string quartet* on campus—all students.And it so happened that the cellist graduated last year. They've been *searching high and low* for a replacement, someone with experience.Would you be interested in *auditioning*?

FEMALE STUDENT: Absolutely. I wanted to get my academic work settled before pursuing my music here. But I think this would be a good thing for me. I guess if I really want to fit in here I should find people who love music as much as I do. Thank you.

MALE COUNSELOR: My pleasure.
