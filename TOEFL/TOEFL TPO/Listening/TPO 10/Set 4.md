NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the University bookstore.

MALE STUDENT: Hi, I bought this book at the beginning of the semester, but, something's come up and... I'd like to return it.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Well, for a full refund, store policy is that you have to return *merchandise* 2 weeks from the time it was purchased, er... but for science text books or anything having to do with specific courses. Wait... was it for specific course?

MALE STUDENT: Yeah, but actually...

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Well... for course books, the deadline is 4 weeks after the beginning of the semester. So for this fall semester, the deadline was October 1st.

MALE STUDENT: Ouch, then I missed it. But, why October 1st?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Emm, I guess the reasoning is that by October 1st, the semester is *in full gear*. And everyone kinda knows what courses they’ll be taking that semester

MALE STUDENT: I get it.so it's mainly for people who decide to withdraw from… or to change to new courses early on.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Exactly! The books have to be in perfect condition of course. They can't be marked up or looked used in any way for the full refund, I mean.

MALE STUDENT: Well, but, my situation is a little different. I hoped you might be able to make an exception.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Well, the policy is generally pretty rigid and the semester is almost over.

MALE STUDENT: Okay, here is what happened? Um, I think my professor really *miscalculated*. Anyway the *syllabus* was way too ambitious in my opinion. There're only 2 weeks of classes left in the semester and there are like 6 books on the syllabus that we haven't even touched.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: I see. So you're hoping to return in this one.

MALE STUDENT: Yeah, professor already announced that we won't be reading this one by *Jane Bowles* and all the others I bought used.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Jane Bowles? Which book of hers?

MALE STUDENT: It's called "Two serious ladies".

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Oh, but you should keep that one. Are you interested in literature?

MALE STUDENT: Well. I am in English major.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: You are lucky to have professor who includes the *lesser known writer* like her on the syllabus, you know, not the usual authors we've all read.

MALE STUDENT: So you really think...

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: I do. And especially if you're into literature.

MALE STUDENT: Hem, well, this I *wasn't* expecting. I mean... er, em... Wow.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: I hope you don't think I'm being too *pushy*. If you prefer, you can return the book and arrange for a store credit, you don't qualify for a refund. Policy is policy after all, but you can make an exchange and you can use the credit for your books for next semester. The credit carries over from one semester to the next.

MALE STUDENT: Hmm... that's good to know, but now I am really *intrigued*, I guess that just because we run out of time to read this book in class, doesn't mean that I cannot read it on my own time. You know, I think I'll give it a try.
