NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between a student and a Department *Secretary*.

MALE STUDENT: Hi. Miss Hendrix.

FEMALE SECRETARY: Hi Bret, how are you?

MALE STUDENT: I'm fine except I have a question about my *paycheck*.

FEMALE SECRETARY: Sure. What's up?

MALE STUDENT: Well it's already been several weeks into the semester and my paycheck was supposed to go directly into my bank account but there haven't been any deposits.

FEMALE SECRETARY: That's odd.

MALE STUDENT: Yeah, I thought *graduate teaching assistants* will automatically put on the *payroll* at the beginning of the semester.

FEMALE SECRETARY: They are... Let's see... did you complete all the forms for payroll?

MALE STUDENT: I filled in whatever they sent me, and... I returned it like, at the end of August.

FEMALE SECRETARY: Hum, well, you definitely should have been paid by now. At least two pay periods have passed since then.

MALE STUDENT: I asked the bank and they didn't know anything. Who should I talk to about this, payroll?

FEMALE SECRETARY: I'm going to contact them for you. There was a problem in processing some of the graduate students' payroll paper work, ‘cause their computer program crashed after all the information was processed, and some people’s information couldn’t be *retrieved*.

MALE STUDENT: Oh... but... why didn't anyone let me know?

FEMALE SECRETARY: I don't know how they work over there, ‘cause they couldn't even figure out whose information was missing. And this isn't the first time: Seems like something like this happens every semester.

MALE STUDENT: So... how do I find out if my information was lost?

FEMALE SECRETARY: I will contact them tomorrow morning to see if you're in the system, but you’re probably not.

MALE STUDENT: Well, then, what will I need to do?

FEMALE SECRETARY: Sorry but you will need to fill out those forms again and then I will *fax* them over the payroll office.

MALE STUDENT: And then what? ...well... what I really need to know is... how long till I get some money? I'm already a month behind on my bills and my *tuition's due* soon.

FEMALE SECRETARY: They'll get you into the system the same day they receive your paperwork, so if you do that tomorrow, you’ll get paid next Friday.

MALE STUDENT: That's a long time from now. Will that paycheck include all the money I’m owed?

FEMALE SECRETARY: It should. I will double-check with the payroll department.

MALE STUDENT: And another thing: Is there any way I could get paid sooner? I have been teaching all these weeks...

FEMALE SECRETARY: I know it's not fair but... I don't think they can do anything. All the checks are computed automatically in the system. They can't just... write checks.

MALE STUDENT: But... they are the ones that made a mistake... and... they never told me.

FEMALE SECRETARY: I understand how you feel . If I were you, I'd be upset too. I'll tell you what. when I call them, I will explain the situation and ask if there is any way you can be paid sooner. But I have to tell you that, based on past experiences, you shouldn't count on it.

MALE STUDENT: I understand. Thanks. I know it's not your fault, and that you're doing everything you can.

FEMALE SECRETARY: Well, what I CAN do is make sure that your first check for the total amount the university owes you.

MALE STUDENT: That'll be great! Thank you. I will be on campus about 10 tomorrow morning, and I will come by to see you then.
