NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between two students. They are both studying to be English teachers.

FEMALE STUDENT: Did you register already for your classes next **semester**?

MALE STUDENT: Yes, I did.

FEMALE STUDENT: What did you taking?

MALE STUDENT: Um... **contemporary** literature, English style, um... the teaching **seminar**, and I still have to do my student teaching. I'm gonna help teach a writing class of the junior high.

FEMALE STUDENT: That's a heavy schedule.

MALE STUDENT: Yeah, it will be really busy and I'm also taking a theory class. But I have to quit my job in a couple of weeks because it will be just too much.

FEMALE STUDENT: Where do you work at?

MALE STUDENT: Buster's coffee shop, but just till the end of the month. What are you doing next semester?

FEMALE STUDENT: Actually a teaching **seminar** too. And I will have to start writing my thesis. You know, I'm also going for my master's degree.

MALE STUDENT: So you are not writing any **poetry**, I imagine.

FEMALE STUDENT: No, I was actually thinking about revising some of my **poems** and sending them into places for publication.

MALE STUDENT: Cool, you should. Um, did you hear about that new poetry club, The Poetry Kitchen?

FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, no time.

MALE STUDENT: It's fun. It's Sunday night. You don't do anything at Sunday nights?

FEMALE STUDENT: I do homework Sunday nights.

MALE STUDENT: Well, it’s only from 7:00 to 9:00.

FEMALE STUDENT: Is it every Sunday?

MALE STUDENT: Last Sunday of every month. I don't know about this month, cause it's probably a little too close to Thanksgiving, so they might move it up. I don't know what they are gonna do, but it's a good time, it's fun, some really impressive readings.

FEMALE STUDENT: Who? From our class?

MALE STUDENT: Some people from our class are reading. A lot of them go, sometimes even the professor.

FEMALE STUDENT: Really? I don't know if I would wanna read in front of her.

MALE STUDENT: You wouldn't have to read, you can just watch. I just watched the first time, but it's a good environment to read them, I think anyway.

FEMALE STUDENT: I probably have to write something new, so maybe during the summer, I just can't now.

MALE STUDENT: Yeah, it wouldn't be the same just reading old stuff. Are you gonna do summer school?

FEMALE STUDENT: Definitely. Otherwise, I will be short 6 **credits**, I have no choice.

MALE STUDENT: Yeah, me too. This is the second summer I'll have to take classes. I gotta go now, my Shakespeare class starts in twenty minutes.
