NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between a student and a university theater manager.

FEMALE STUDENT: I'm sorry if my e-mail wasn't clear. It's probably best that we're meeting now. I have a lot of questions.

MALE THEATER MANAGER: So do I. But first let me say that I'm so glad that this tradition is continuing. I guess *for the last twenty years now every senior class has put on a Shakespeare play.*

FEMALE STUDENT: It won't be anything like the drama department's productions in the main theater, but we're really excited. We're doing *As You Like It* this year.

MALE THEATER MANAGER: Great. Let's start with the timing. You-you want the production to run on two *consecutive* nights...a Thursday and Friday?

FEMALE STUDENT: Right. The end of *April* would be best. Maybe the last Thursday and Friday? We're flexible with the dates.

MALE THEATER MANAGER: The only bookings at the small theater are some *recitals* in the beginning of the month. So I'll make sure to get it on the calendar. But your other questions. Let's see... you want to use fire on stage?

FEMALE STUDENT: Well, our idea is to reproduce the conditions of an *Elizabethan playhouse*... make it as *authentic* as possible. And of course they didn't have electric lights five hundred years ago. So we thought if we had candles... a lot of candles, actually...

MALE THEATER MANAGER: To light the stage?

FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah.

MALE THEATER MANAGER: OK. Um... you'd need a special permit. Y-You could get one from the city council. But...for one thing, it's difficult and time-consuming to get permission-and expensive. And it's not just the permit, you'd have to pay for an *inspection* and to have a *fire marshal* present at the shows...

FEMALE STUDENT: That does sound expensive. *If we had a budget like the drama department*... But it looks like we'll have to *scale back* a bit...

MALE THEATER MANAGER: *Are you charging admission*?

FEMALE STUDENT: There'll be a small *admission fee*. In Shakespeare's time, if you paid a little more you got a more comfortable seat. I don't see how we could do that, though. I mean, all the seats are the same, right?

MALE THEATER MANAGER: Right. I guess you could charge more for the seats up front. But it's a small theater...

FEMALE STUDENT: And there isn't much difference between the front and the back.

MALE THEATER MANAGER: Anyway, for lighting, you could buy those electric lanterns that are made to look as if they have a natural flame.

FEMALE STUDENT: If that's the best we can do. Not exactly authentic, though.

MALE THEATER MANAGER: But safer and less expensive. And about the food...

FEMALE STUDENT: Selling food was also done in Shakespeare's time. It's related to the candles, actually. When the candles burned down, they stopped the play-so they could bring out new ones-and that's when they sold snacks. That's how the custom of having an *intermission* started.

MALE THEATER MANAGER: I'd always thought intermissions began as a way to change the scenery.

FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, speaking of scenery, do you have the *exact dimensions* of the stage?

MALE THEATER MANAGER: Sure.
