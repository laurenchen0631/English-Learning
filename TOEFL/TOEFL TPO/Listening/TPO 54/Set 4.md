NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between a student and the professor of her theater class.

FEMALE STUDENT: So, Professor Baker…about our next assignment you talked about in class…

MALE PROFESSOR:  Yes, this time you’ll be in groups of three. Each of you will have a chance to direct the other two in a short scene from a play you’ve chosen yourself…

FEMALE STUDENT: Right, and, well… I’ve been reading about *story theatre*, and…

MALE PROFESSOR:  Ah, story theatre. Tell me about what you’ve read.

FEMALE STUDENT: Well… it’s a form of theater where folk- or fairy tales are acted out. It was, uh… introduced by the director *Paul Sills*, in the 1960s. In Sills’s approach, an actor both *narrates* and acts out a tale. So, like, someone will appear on stage, and then they’ll start narrating a tale about, say, a king. And then the same person will immediately switch to and start acting out the role of the king. With no props or scenery.

MALE PROFESSOR: Sills. You know, I actually saw his first story theatre production, in 1968. He did the fairy tale “The Blue Light.”

FEMALE STUDENT: Really? So…whatever gave him the idea to produce that?

MALE PROFESSOR:  Well… As you know, back in the late 1960s lots of people in the United States were *disillusioned* with the government. Sills was *grappling with* how to produce theater that was… *relevant* in such times. Then he happened to read “The Blue Light,” and he realized it had just the message he wanted.

See, in the story, a man who’s lost all hope as a result of the unfortunate events in his life completely turns his life around…with the help of a magical blue light. So, the blue light in the story symbolizes a way out of seemingly unsolvable human problems. And for Sills, that light symbolized an answer to the political *turmoil* in the U.S.

FEMALE STUDENT: But weren’t you…um, audiences…bothered that the actors were performing on a *bare* stage?

MALE PROFESSOR: Well, story theatre is a departure from traditional dramatic theater…with its realistic, elaborate props and scenery.But Sills could make us “see”… say, a big, tall mountain…through the facial expressions and body movements of the actors—and their telling of the story. We were all *swept up*, energized by such an innovative approach to theater—even if one or two of the critics *weren’t* as enthusiastic.

FEMALE STUDENT: Cool. So, uh, anyway… What I really wanted to ask… I’d love to try doing story theatre for my project, instead of just a scene from a traditional play.

MALE PROFESSOR:  Hmmm… That’s possible—a -a short tale can be about the same length as a single scene… Which fairy tale would you do?

FEMALE STUDENT: Actually, I was reading about another director of story theatre? *Rex Stephenson*? You know—he produces plays based on folk tales as well. Maybe I could direct one of those?

MALE PROFESSOR: Ohhhhkay, yes—Rex Stephenson.Now, Stephenson’s style of story theatre is a little different from Sills’s— He’ll use simple props…a chair will represent a mountain…but the significant difference is with the narrator…*the narrator will play only that role*. Let’s talk about why…
