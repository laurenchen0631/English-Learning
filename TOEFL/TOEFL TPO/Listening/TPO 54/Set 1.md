NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the university’s historical library.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Morning! What can I help you find?

MALE STUDENT:  Well, I saw on the Internet that the university library has menus *and things* from local restaurants— like *The Springfield Eatery*?

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Right. A lot of local businesses have donated materials to our collection, including that restaurant. I’m pretty sure we have, uh, *ten or fifteen boxes of materials* from there.

MALE STUDENT:  Good. I thought you were located in the main library, so I went there first and they sent me here. I hadn’t realized the university had a separate historical library. I think what you’re doing is great—collecting local documents and photos—keeping a record of the region.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: I’m glad you see the value in it. We’ve been collecting materials for going on seventy years now. Last year we had an exhibition that showcased how the *town square* has changed over the past 50 years. So that got the word out a little...but you’re right—a lot of students don’t know we exist. Well, unless they’re majoring in history. So, you’re looking for something for a class?

MALE STUDENT: Not exactly. My grandmother went to this university, and while she was here, she worked as a waitress.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: At The Springfield Eatery.

MALE STUDENT:  Yes, and that’s where she met my grandfather! So, they’re celebrating their fiftieth anniversary this year, and I noticed online that you have old menus from some of the restaurants. I was thinking I could find one from the year they met and frame a copy for them.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: What a unique idea! What year are you looking for?

MALE STUDENT:  Uh, 1954.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: I know we have a few menus from the 1950s, but you’ll have to check...there are some gaps…some years we didn’t receive any new materials, and sometimes restaurants go a while without changing their menus...

MALE STUDENT:  Oh no! I really wanted to give them something special.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Well… how about this: We also have a lot of photos, so maybe you could find one of your grandmother—or maybe even one with both of your grandparents.

MALE STUDENT:  That’d be awesome!

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: The only thing is, most of our materials are still in boxes—no one’s ever taken the time to organize them, so it-it might require a fair amount of *sifting*.

MALE STUDENT:  Hmm…I have a couple of tests coming up, but I can take a quick look, if that’s OK. I know some libraries have special rules for handling delicate or old materials.

FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Well, these aren’t particularly old. Just the usual rules apply…no food or drinks.

MALE STUDENT:  OK. Thanks for your help!
