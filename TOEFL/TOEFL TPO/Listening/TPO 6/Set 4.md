NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.

FEMALE STUDENT: Professor Martin?

MALE PROFESSOR: Uh, hi, Lisa, what can I do for you?

FEMALE STUDENT: Well, I've been thinking about, you know, what you were saying in class last week, about how we *shouldn't* wait until the last minute to find an idea and get started working on our term paper.

MALE PROFESSOR: Good, good, and have you come up with anything?

FEMALE STUDENT: Well, yeah, sort of—see, I've never had a linguistics class before, so I was sort of... I mean, I was looking over the course description and a lot of the stuff you described there, I just don't know what it is talking about, you know, or what it means. But there was one thing that really did *jump out at me*.

MALE PROFESSOR: Yes?

FEMALE STUDENT: The section on *dialects*, 'cause ...like, that's the kind of thing that's always sort of *intrigued* me, you know?

MALE PROFESSOR: Well, that's certainly an interesting topic, but you may not realize, I mean, the scope...

FEMALE STUDENT: Well, especially now, 'cause I've got, like one roommate who is from the south and another one from New York, and we all talk like totally different, you know?

MALE PROFESSOR: Yes, I understand. But...

FEMALE STUDENT: But then I was noticing, like, we don't really get into this till the end of the semester, you know. So I...

MALE PROFESSOR: So, you want some pointers where to go for information on the subject? Well, you could always start by reading the chapter in the book on *sociolinguistics*; that will give you a basic understanding of the key issues involved here.

FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, that's what I thought. So I started reading the chapter, you know, about how everyone speaks some dialect of a language. And I'm wondering like, well, how do we even manage to understand each other at all?

MALE PROFESSOR: Ah, yes, an interesting question. You see...

FEMALE STUDENT: So then I read the part about “*dialect accommodation*”— you know, the idea that people tend to adapt their speaking to make it closer to the speech of whomever they're talking to, and I'm thinking, yeah, I do that when I talk with my roommates, and without even thinking about it or anything, you know.

MALE PROFESSOR: Okay, all right— “dialect accommodation” is a more manageable sort of topic…

FEMALE STUDENT: So I was thinking like, I wonder just how much other people do the same thing. I mean, there’re students here from all over the place; does everyone change the way they talk to some degree, depending on who they’re talking to?

MALE PROFESSOR: You'd be surprised.

FEMALE STUDENT: So, anyway, my question is, do you think it'd be OK if I did a project like that for my term paper? You know, find students from different parts of the country, record them talking to each other in different combinations, report on how they *accommodate* their speech or not, that kind of thing?

MALE PROFESSOR: Tell you what, Lisa, write me up a short proposal for this project, how you're going to carry out the experiment and everything, a design plan—and I think this’ll work out just fine!
