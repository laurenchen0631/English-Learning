[Listened Article]
It is a common knowledge that whales and dolphins can hear and make sounds. But the extent to which see mammals use sound to communicate and navigate was not known until World War Two. During the war, hydrophones were developed to detect to submarines but they also pick up a vast array of sound produced by sea mammals. As long as using sona language for social communication whales will found to emit sound to help them detect obstacles by bouncing sound of them, in other words, by utilizing echoes. These phenomena may help to explain why whales sometimes appeared to commit a suicide by heading into shallow waters for they get stuck and die suffocation. When no longer support by the sea, the weight of their body make it impossible for them to breathe. It has been found that such stranding almost always occur on gently sloping sandy or muddy bottoms where whales can't get the same sharp echoes that they can get from steep rocky coast.

It is common knowledge that whales and dolphins can hear and make sounds, but the extend to which sea mammals use sound to communicate and navigate was not known until Word War II. During the war, hydrophones were developed to detect submarines, but they also picked up a vast array of sounds produced by sea mammals. As well as using sonar language for social communication, whales were found to emit sounds to help them detect obstacles by bouncing sounds off of them - in other words, by utilizing echoes. This phenomenon may help to explain why whales sometimes appear to commit "suicide" by heading into shallow waters where they get stuck and die of suffocation, when no longer supported by the sea, the weight of their bodies makes it impossible for them to breathe. It has been found that such strandings almost always occur on gently sloping sandy or muddy bottoms, where whales cannot get the same sharp echoes they can get from steep rocky coasts.
