In 1912 the German meteorologist ?? made a serious study of astonishing proposal, already dismissed by others, that the continents had one time formed one land mass before drifting apart. He showed how several the opposite coasts of sunder continents could at one time have fitted together. For example, the excellent fitted the coast of the Gulf of Gini to the coast of Broziyo. ? also used the arguments for continental drift for anomalous currencies of cold deposit in polar regions and former glaciation in what are now the ?. Also, South Africa geologist, A.L. ?, pointed out the observed anomalous distribution fossil could be explained if India and all sirlent continents at former times had been a part of super continent that he named ?. According to his theory, an ocean situated at long present line of the elpine Himalaya Mountain Chain had separated ? from another super continent called ?. The break of ? caused India to move north until coalesce with Asia.

[Real Article]
In 1912 the German meteorologist Alfred Wegener made a serious serious study of the astonishing proposal, already dismissed by others, that the continents has at one time formed one land mass before drifting apart. He showed how several of opposite coasts of southern continents could at one time have fitted together - for example, the excellent fit of the coast of the Gulf of Guinea to the coast of Brazil. Wegener also used the arguments for continental drift for the anomalous occurrences of coal deposits in polar regions and of former glaciations in what are now the tropics. Also, a South African geologist, A. L. du Toit, pointed out that the observed anomalous distribution of fossils could be explained if India and all the southern continents had in former times been a part of a supercontinent that he named Gondwanaland. According to his theory, an ocean situated along the present line of Alpine-Himalayan mountain chains had separated Gondwanaland from another supercontinent, called Laurasia. The breakup of Gondwanaland caused India to move north, until it coalesced with Asia.
