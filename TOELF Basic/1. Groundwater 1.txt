Groundwater is a major source of mankind's usable water. It is found everywhere under the earth's surface from beneath the desert of Death Valley to the highest peak of Himalayas. It surges up through wells and springs supporting life on farms and towns as well as supplying large cities. When surface water is scarce, groundwater serves a vital supply for irrigation, and the people ... rights to it. Ground can rarely be seen except when it seeds up into a well or flows from a spring. But scientists can estimate how much it stores at given a location, how fast it is moving, how soon pumping a well will affect another well, where the water comes from and where it will be found years in the future. So important is groundwater the hundreds of scientists spend their time mapping its location for the purpose of management and conservation.
