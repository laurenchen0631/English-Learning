In 1876, Thomas Edison established an invention factory, the prototype of today's engineering laboratories and ?? New Jersy, there he assembled the handful ?? systems and ?? to do nothing but work on inventions. Edison's goal was a minor invention every 10 days and a big thing every 6 months so and objective was readily achieved. By the time he left laboratory in 1887, Edison had received almost 400 patterns, including one for practical ?? lab and electric system and one for the photograph. Perhaps Edison's the greatest invention, however, was his organized approach to problem solving. Edison explored every aspect of problem and possible solutions, striving to solve even those unique problems associated with his inventions. For example, by developing generators, fuses and ??s, Edison made the electric light practical to reality rather than mere novelty.

In 1876 Thomas Edison established an "invention factory", the prototype of today's engineering laboratories, in Menlo Park, New Jersey. There he assembled a handful of yong assistants and a dozen of mechanics to do nothing but work on inventions. Edison's goal was "a minor invention every ten days and a big thing every six months or so," an objective that was readily achieved. By the time he left laboratory in 1887, Edison had received almost 400 patents, including one for practical incandescent lamp and electric system and one for phonograph. Perhaps Edison's greatest invention, however, was his organized approach to problem solving. Edison explored every aspect of a problem an its possible solutions, striving to solve even those unique problems associated with his inventions. For example, by developing generator, fuses, ad conduits, Edison made the electric light a practical reality rather than a mere novelty.
