[Listened Article]
A molecule is the smallest particle of chemical substances that is capable of independent systems. Molecules consist a or more atoms, and they may contain one or more kinds of atoms. A single atom or modertomic molecule are the ? or rare gases, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, and ?. These elements are neutral and their atom show little tendency to combine with each other. The smallest molecule is hydrogen molecule, which has diameter of 2.3-2.4 ? unit, and ? the extremely small size of molecule is familiar substance, water. It is provide by the fat. They are about many molecules in a tea spoon of water and there are a tea spoon of water in the ?. The largest molecule is complicated organic molecules, such as protein and ? (DNA), which contain thousands of individual latents, they may ware several millions time as much as hydrogen.

[Real Article]
A molecule is the smallest particle of a chemical substance that is capable of independent existence. Molecules consist of one or more atoms and they may contain one or more kinds of atoms. The single-atom, or monatomic, molecules are the noble, or rare, gases - helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon. These elements are unusual in that their atoms show little tendency to combine with each other. The smallest molecules is the hydrogen molecule, which has a diameter of 2.3 to 2.4 Angstrom units. An idea of the extremely small size of the molecules of a familiar substance - water - is provided by the fact there are about as many molecules in a teaspoon of water as there are teaspoons of water in the Atlantic Ocean. The largest molecules are complicated organic molecules such as protein and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which contain thousands of individual atoms. They may weigh several million times as much as hydrogen.
