American scientists, on the other hand, study animal on a controlled laboratory condition. One man, however, had respected the both group, Conraze Laranz of Austria. He developed a new approach based on a idea that animal behavior is determined by struggle for survival. And that is for product adaptive evolution just animal physical feature are. He studied a wide variety of creatures, frogs, dogs, ducks and monkeys among others. One of his technique was to learn the language of the animal that he can approach them better. Among his discoveries was that if gasoline lose their mothers they will accept substitute. In fact, a group of such gasoline adopt Laranz as their mother, happily following him around.

When the science of animal behavior was still in its infancy, researchers split into two schools of thought. European scholars stressed instinctive behavior, preferring to observe and test animals in their natural surroundings. American scientists, on the other hand, studied animal under controlled laboratory conditions. One man, however, had the respect of both groups: Konrad Z. Lorenz of Austria. He developed a new approach based on the idea that an animal's behavior is determined by its struggle for survival and is therefore the product of adaptive evolution, just as an animal's physical features are. He studied a wide variety of creatures: frogs, dogs, ducks, and monkeys, among others. One of his technique was to learn the "language" of animals so that he could approach them better. Among his discoveries was that if goslings lose their mother, they will accept a substitute. In fact, a group of such goslings adopted Lorenz as their mother, happily following him around.
