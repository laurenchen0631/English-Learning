As noted by Sr John Echoes who shared the Noble Prize for Medicine in 1973, the task of understanding in the comprehensive way how the human brain operate staggers his own imagination. The human brain is the most complex and highly specialized organ in the human body. Structurely it is a mass human tissue, weighing about 1.3 kilograms, and consisting more than 10 billion cells. Together with supinal cord, it makes up the central nerve system. A primary function of brain is to coordinate all of the nervous activities of the body. The brain receives incoming nerve impulses from the eyes, ears and other sensory organs. Ennalized this information taking path experience into the count and initiate the necessary adjustment and movements. The human nerve systems is sometimes compared to huge telephone systems in which they are millions of miles of wire. If this wire were not connected to the central switch port, it would be useless. Similarly, man's peripheral nerve system which has many miles of nerve fibers would be little value if the fibers were not connected to the central coordinating structure, the brain.

The human brain is the most complex and highly specialized organ in the human body. Structurally, it is a mass of human tissue, weighing about 1.3 kg and consisting of more than 10 billion cells. Together with the spinal cord it makes up the central nervous system. A primary function of the brain is to coordinate all of the nervous activity of the body. The brain receives incoming nerve impulses from the eyes, ears, and other sensory organs, analyzes the information, taking past experience into account, and initiates the necessary adjustments and movements. The human nervous system is sometimes compared to a huge telephone system in which there are millions of miles of wire. If this wire were not connected to a central switchboard, it would be useless. Similarly, man's peripheral nervous system, which has many miles of nerve fibers, would be of little value if the fibers were not connected to a central coordinating structure, the brain.
