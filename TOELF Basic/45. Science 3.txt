As astronomers explore the vast outer reaches space, physicists are busy working opposite end of spectrum, study in the micro world of particles that make up all things. Until late 19th century, the smallest recognized unit of matter is the atom, of which 92 basic type comprise 92 elements which compose all ordinary materials. With the development of complex scientific instruments, however, physicist learned that atom can be broken apart into much smaller particles. The tiny nature of these particles strains the imagination. Some measure least a trillion of a centimeter across, and some may exist for only a trillion of a second. Astronomers play with the idea of a infinitely large universe. Physicist are wondering if there is a limit to smallness.

As astronomers explore the vast outer reaches of space, physicists are busy working at the opposite end of the spectrum, studying the microworld of particles that make up all things. Until the late 19th century, the smallest recognized unit of matter was the atom, of which 92 basic types comprise 92 elements, which compose all ordinary materials. With the development of complex scientific instruments, however, physicists learned that atoms could be broken apart into much smaller particles. The tiny nature of these particles strains the imagination: some measure less than a trillionth of a centimeter across, and some may exist for only a trillionth of a second. While astronomers play with the idea of an infinitely large universe, physicists are wondering if there is a limit to smallness.
