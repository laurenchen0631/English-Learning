The age of steam power is commonly thought to have started by James Watt, but history of steam technology in fact goes back much further. In ancient Greece, hero of Aliksamdria wrote about devices such as automatic door-opening contraption which were powered by steam. Many centuries later, Gaoleon, Tochali, and Decoce determined the basic principle of steam technology. Among their 17th century finding were that water convert to steam when boiled and steam expands during this process with a liter of water capable of producing about 1,600 liters of steam. These scientists also discovered the awesome power produced by this conversion. Not only can steam produce raised lid of pot but it can also blow up the boiler in which is trapped. They also found that when steam cools it reverts back to water and that if this process occurs in the coalesced container it creates vacuum.

In ancient Greece, Hero of Alexandria wrote about devices, such as an automatic door-opening contraption, which were powered by steam. Many centuries later, Galileo, Torricelli and De Caus determined the basic principles of steam technology. Among their 17th-century findings were that water converts to steam when boiled and that steam expands during this process, with a liter of water capable of producing about 1,600 liters of steam. These scientists also discovered the awesome power produced by this conversion - not only can the steam produced raise the lid off a pot but it can also blow up a boiler in which it is trapper. They also found that when steam cools, it reverts back to water and that if this process occurs in a closed container, it creates a vacuum.
