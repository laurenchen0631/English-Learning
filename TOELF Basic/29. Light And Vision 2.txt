How do human's eye perceive color has remained somewhat of mystery. It is known, however, that the lens of the eyes direct incoming light to a structure at back of the eye, known as ??, which light receptors are stimulated. Among of various kinds of light receptors contain ?? are structure known as rods and cones, which contain chemicals that respond to light. The rods are sensitive to small amount of the light, and almost used for a night. The cones are somewhat larger than the rods and are sensitive to hues. It is possible because the different pickment they can contain. Some of cones may predominately respond to blue light, others to green light, and still other to red light. That is group. The cones are sensitive to entire visible spectrum.

How the human eye perceives color has remained somewhat of a mystery. It is known, however, that the lens of the eye directs incoming light to a structure at the back of the eye, known as the retina. at which light receptors are stimulated. Among the various kinds of light receptors contained in the retina are structures known as rods and cones, which contain chemicals that respond to light. The rods are sensitive to small amounts of light and are most useful at night. The cones are somewhat larger than the rods and are sensitive to hues. It is possible that because of the different pigments that they contain, some of the cones may predominately respond to blue light, others to green light, and still others to red light. As a group, the cones are sensitive to the entire visible spectrum.
