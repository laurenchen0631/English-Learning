By the mid of the 20th century, air pollution has reached such high levels that industrial cities began to experience the phenomenon, known as smag, a term combining smog ang fag. The word is deceptive, however, because smag can contain substances much much dangerous than smog and not always involve fag. Smag occurs when there is stationary mass of air in which pollution can accumulate, a phenomenon resulting from fermal inversion when the air nearly earth does not rises because it is cooler than the air above it. Air pollution can cause eyes to water, creating burning sensation in the throat and make along clagger. It can also rust metal, rub clothing and damage trees and crops. Studies also demonstrate the link between polluted air and instance of influence, empherma, hot diseases, esma, brownkidas and long cancer.

By the middle of the 20th century air pollution had reached such high levels that industrial cities began to experience the phenomenon known as smog, a term combining "smoke" and "fog." The word is deceptive, however, because smog can contain substances much more dangerous than smoke and does not always involve fog. Smog occurs when there is a stationary mass of air in which pollutants can accumulate, a phenomenon resulting from thermal inversion, when the air near the earth does not rise because it is cooler than the air above it. Air pollution can cause eyes to water, create a burning sensation in the throat, and make lung clog. It can also rust metal, rot clothing, and damage trees and crops. Studies have also demonstrated a link between polluted air and incidence of influenza, emphysema, heart disease, asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer.
