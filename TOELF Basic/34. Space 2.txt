[Listened Article]
As astronomers succeed in probing ever farther into space, they were discovering just how vast the universe is. Because astronomers must deal with the immense distances, they developed special unit to measure them. To eliminate long string 0s, they use the "light year", a distance traveled by light in a year, or almost 10 trillion kilometers. Our galaxy, in a milky way, measure 20,000 light years to center and 100,000 from end to end. The sun is the largest object in our solar system but it is only one star among 100 billion in a milky way, which in term is one galaxy among billions that extends billions of light years into space. Even further away are tiny points of light, called quazas, the scientists are only beginning to understand.

As astronomers succeed in probing ever farther into space, they are discovering just how vast the universe is. Because astronomers must deal with immense distances, they have developed special units to measure them. To eliminate long strings of zeros, they suse the light-year, the distance traveled by light in a year, or almost 10,000,000,000,000 kilometers. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, measures 20,000 light-years through its center and 100,000 from end to end. The sun is the largest object in our solar system but is only one star among hundreds of billions in the Milky Way, which in turn is only one galaxy among billions that extend for billions of light-years into space. Even farther away are tiny, brilliant points of light called quasars that scientists are only beginning to understand.

- The sun is the largest object in our solar system but is only one star among hundreds of billions in the Milky Way, which in turn is only one galaxy among billions that extend for billions of light-years into space. 太陽是我們的太陽系當中最大的星體，但太陽只是銀河系中數千億個恆星之一，而銀河也是數十一個星系中的一個，這些星系在太空裡延展了數十億個光年
- quasar 類星體
