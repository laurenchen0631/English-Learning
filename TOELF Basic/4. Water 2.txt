Droughts has always been considered deviation from normal weather patterns. But in fact, they occurs somewhere in the world every year. In some places, they come an go on a almost regular basis. For example, the Sehala region, the north-centra Africa, suffer major droughts from 1910 to 1913, and again from 1938 to 1942. In the United States, its survier droughts struck the western potion of the country in 1930s and again in 1950s. It is not possible to predict when or where droughts would occur. Many climatologists believe that generally mile weather over much the global from 1890 to 1945 what is a deviation from a long-termed global cooling train. The show breaks for this cooling train may be caused by the rising carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide ... for the sun. Of the phenomenon known as green house effect. Regardless of the world is getting warmer or cooler, it is certain that even a small changes in climate can upset weather pattern, which has a drift effect on water supplies and other aspects in environment.

Droughts have always been considered deviations from normal weather patterns, but, in fact, they occur somewhere in the world every year. In some places they come and go on an almost regular basis. For example, the Sahel region of North Central Africa suffered major droughts from 1910 to 1913 and then again 1938 to 1942. In the United States, a severe drought struck the western portion of the country in 1930's and then again in the 1950's. It is not possible to predict when or where droughts will occur.
Many climatologists believe that the generally mild weather over much of the globe from 1890 to 1945 was a deviation from a long-term global cooling trend. The short break from this cooling trend may have caused by a rise in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide tends to trap heat from the sun, a phenomenon known as the "greenhouse effect." Regardless of whether the world is getting warmer or cooler, it is certain that even small changes in climate can upset weather patterns, which have a direct effect on water supplies and other aspects of the environment.
