Fears abound that the world's non-renewable energy supplies would eventually be exhausted. However, human beings use a ... fraction vast mountain energy produced by nature every day. Humans beings use only 1 or 2 percent of power produced by rivers, for example, but such hydroelectric could make any percent of our needs. Wind power could produce twice as much as electricity that water does now. If the power of tide can be harnessed, it could meet half of the world's energy needs. The greatest produced energy is the sun. If the total supply of the world fuel was concentrated in one place and burned at the rate to match the sun's energy, they will be consumed within 3 days. So, even the world's non-renewable energy supply decreases, limitless energy possibilities remain to be tapped.
