The earth is the only planet in the solar system that human has explored extensively. Even after roaming the earth for 2,000,000 years, human still do not know much about the planet. Firsthand knowledge is restricted to the thin layer of rocky water extending a few kilometers below the earth's surface and up to the highest stratum of the earth's atmosphere. Where human have not been able to venture, probes have been sent. The spacecraft to view the earth from outer space and sizemological poses to study the planet's core. The knowledge does gain can often be applied to other planets that are believed to be created in a similar way to the earth, which is born from dust and gases left over from the creation of the sun. Once being wearing about the earth's structure and atmosphere provide clues to what is explored may expect when they venture deep into space.

The earth is the only planet in the solar system that humans have explored extensively. Yet even after roaming the earth for two million years, humans still do not know much about the planet. Firsthand knowledge is restricted to the thin layer of rock and water extending a few kilometers below the earth's surface and up to the highest stratum of the earth's atmosphere. Where human have not been able to venture, probes have been sent: spacecraft to view the earth from outer space and seismological pulses to study the planet's core. The knowledge thus gained can often be applied to other planets that are believed to have been created in a similar way to the earth, which was born from dust and gases left over from the creation of the sun. What is being learned about the earth's structure and atmosphere provides clues to what explorers may expect when they venture deep in space.
