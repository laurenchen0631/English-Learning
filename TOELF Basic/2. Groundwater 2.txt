An adequate supply of water is vital for all forms of animal and plant life from the smallest ameba to the tallest tree. Water makes up about 50% of every living organism. A person would die if you lost more than 15% of his body's water. In the body, water dissolve distribute vital elements such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, salts. It is essential for blood circulation that remove the wastes and move to the muscle. Without water, human being can even not open his eyes. The water and organism's loss through secuarlion and evaporation must constantly be replaced. This never-ending thirst is believed to be a legacy of the ocean origin of life. The concentration salt and human being is about 0.9%, a level that biochemist believe it is the same as that sea 400,000,000 years ago. When the first organism venture from the ocean to the land. So in one sense human beings still carry within their body water which their ancestors evolve a long ago.
