# Verbals
* There are 3 types of verbals: participles, gerunds, and infinitives.
* Participles (分詞)
	* A participle is used as an **adjective**
	* Present Participles: **V + -ing**

		* The little girl was *bitten* by the dog.
		* You should walk cautiously on the *frozen* pond.
* Gerund (動名詞)
	* A gerund is a **verb ending with -ing** and acts as a **noun**.
		* *Running* up steep hills for the last six months has greatly increased my stamina. 
		* Hector thought he could impress his boss by *staying* late at the office. 
	* You need to use a possessive noun/pronoun before a gerund rather than a object because gerunds are nouns.
