# Verbals
* There are 3 types of verbals: participles, gerunds, and infinitives.
* Participles (分詞)
	* A participle is used as an **adjective**
	* Present Participles: **V + -ing**
		* Just let *sleeping* dogs lie. 
		* *Shivering* from the cold, Robert went immediately to the coffeepot and poured himself a large cup. 
		* Feeling hungry, he went into the kitchen and opened the fridge.
		* They have been *walking*.
		* I heard someone *singing*.
	* Past Participles: **Ved or irregular**
		* The entire team, *exhilarated* from the unexpected victory, embraced the cheering fans. 
		* The little girl was *bitten* by the dog.
		* You should walk cautiously on the *frozen* pond.
* Gerund (動名詞)
	* A gerund is a **verb ending with -ing** and acts as a **noun**.
		* *Running* up steep hills for the last six months has greatly increased my stamina. 
		* Hector thought he could impress his boss by *staying* late at the office. 
	* You need to use a *possessive (所有格)* noun/pronoun before a gerund rather than a object because gerunds are nouns.
		* James continues to be amazed by ~~Barbara~~ *Barbara’s singing*. 
		* I was upset about ~~us~~ *our leaving* so early in the morning. 
* Infinitive (不定詞)
	* An infinitive is composed of to + V. Most of time they are used as nouns, but sometimes they are utilized as adjectives or adverbs.
		* “I want *to go* home!” cried the youngster.  (noun)
		* We come *to bury* Caesar. (adverb)
		* Harry was the first guy in our crowd *to marry*. (adjective)
	* Sometimes the **to is omitted**.
		* “Please help me (to) make the bed before your parents get here,” Arthur said to his wife.
