All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion, childcare, food? And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them? 

You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice of **Henry Higgins** in "*My Fair Lady*": Stick to the weather and your health. But these days, with climate change and **anti-vaxxing**, those subjects are not safe either. So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to **devolve** into an argument, where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal. **Pew** Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more **polarized**, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history. We're less likely to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other. And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe. Again, that means we're not listening to each other. A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.

		> 轉讓|(of property) be transferred from one owner to (another), especially by inheritance.|

Now, part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly. According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day. And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face. There's this great piece in The **Atlantic**. It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. And he gave his kids a communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes. And he said this: "I came to realize..." 
	- Atlantic /atˈlantɪk/

"I came to realize that conversational **competence** might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach. Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to **hone** their interpersonal communications skills. It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to **sustain** **coherent**, confident conversation?" 
	+ competence, competency /ˈkɒmpɪt(ə)ns/ 
		> 能力 |The ability to do something successfully or efficiently| courses to improve the competence of staff
		> 權限 |The legal authority of a court or other body to deal with a particular matter.| the court's competence has been accepted to cover these matters
		> 語言潛意識 |A person's subconscious knowledge of the rules governing the formation of speech in their first language.|
		> 足以過著舒適生活的收入 |An income large enough to live on, typically an unearned one.|

		> 鍛鍊 |Give greater strength or firmness to (the body or a part of the body)| she has been working hard to hone her physique

Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, **kindergarten** teachers, **heads of state**, **plumbers**. I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like. I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level. But I still have a great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen. 
	- kindergarten /ˈkɪndəˌɡɑːt(ə)n/ 幼稚園/托兒所
	- head of state 國家元首
	- plumber 水管工人/水電工 == A person who fits and repairs the pipes, fittings, and other apparatus of water supply, sanitation, or heating systems.

Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, **nod** and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is **crap**. 
	- nod /nɒd/ 
	- crap
		> 垃圾 |Something of extremely poor quality.|
		> 不合理 |Nonsense.|
		> 廢物 |Unwanted articles; rubbish.|
		> 排泄物 |Excrement.|
		> 排泄 |An act of defecation.|
		> 排泄 |Defecate.|

There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention. 

Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists. Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody. 

We've all had really great conversations. We've had them before. We know what it's like. The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that. 

So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations. 

Number one: Don't multitask. And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand. I mean, be present. Be in that moment. Don't think about your argument you had with your boss. Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be **half** in it and half out of it. 

Number two: Don't **pontificate**. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or **growth**, write a blog. 
	+ pontificate
		> 教皇 |(in the Roman Catholic Church) the office or period of office of a pope or bishop.| Pope Gregory VIII enjoyed only a ten-week pontificate
		> 自以為是地發表意見/武斷地發表意見 |Express one*s opinions in a pompous and dogmatic way.| he was pontificating about art and history
		> 主持彌撒 |(in the Roman Catholic Church) officiate as bishop, especially at Mass.| he pontificated at three Christmas Masses

Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow **pundits** on my show: Because they're really boring. If they're **conservative**, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and **Dick Cheney**. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. The famed therapist **M. Scott Peck** said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself. And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion. He said that sensing this **acceptance**, the speaker will become less and less **vulnerable** and more and more likely to open up the inner **recesses** of his or her mind to the listener. Again, assume that you have something to learn. 
	- pundit 專家/權威 == An expert in a particular subject or field who is frequently called upon to give their opinions to the public.
	- conservative /kənˈsəːvətɪv/ 
	- Dick Cheney 迪克·錢尼，是小布希任內的美國副總統，錢尼被廣泛認為是美國歷史上最有實權的副總統
	- acceptance /əkˈsɛpt(ə)ns/ 
	- vulnerable /ˈvʌln(ə)rəb(ə)l/ 
	- inner recess 內心深處

**Bill Nye**: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't." I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something. 

Number three: Use **open-ended** questions. In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how. If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you, "Were you terrified?" you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't." "Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry." Let them describe it. They're the ones that know. Try asking them things like, "What was that like?" "How did that feel?" Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting response. 
	- open-ended
		> 未預作安排的 |Having no predetermined limit or boundary.|
		> 開放式的 |(of a question) allowing the formulation of any answer, rather than a selection from a set of possible answers.|

Number four: Go with the flow. That means **thoughts** will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind. We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered. That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that. And we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met **Hugh Jackman** in a coffee shop. 
	- Hugh Jackman 休·傑克曼，一名澳洲演員、歌手及製片人。他在「X戰警系列電影」中長期飾演「金鋼狼」一角而廣為人知

And we stop listening. Stories and ideas are going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go. 

Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know. Now, people on the radio, especially on **NPR**, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk should not be cheap. 
	- NPR == National Public Radio 全國公共廣播電台，是美國一家獲公眾贊助及部分政府資助、但獨立運作的非商業性媒體機構
	? err on the side of caution 寧願過於謹慎也不要冒險犯錯
		> 25 people have replied to the invitation, but I've erred on the side of caution and put out 30 chairs.

Number six: Don't **equate** your experience with theirs. If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member. If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job. It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly, it is not about you. You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. Somebody asked **Stephen Hawking** once what his IQ was, and he said, "I have no idea. People who **brag** about their IQs are losers." Conversations are not a promotional opportunity. 
	- equate /ɪˈkweɪt/ 
	- Stephen Hawking 史蒂芬·威廉·霍金，英國理論物理學家、宇宙學家及作家，生前任職劍橋大學理論宇宙學中心研究主任，20世紀當代最偉大的物理學家之一
	- brag /braɡ/ 

Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself. It's **condescending**, and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep **rephrasing** it over and over. Don't do that. 
	- condescending /kɒndɪˈsɛndɪŋ/ 高傲的 == Having or showing an attitude of patronizing superiority.
	- rephrase 改變措辭 == Express (an idea or question) in an alternative way, especially for the purpose of clarification.

Number eight: Stay out of the **weeds**. Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. They don't care. What they care about is you. They care about what you're like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out. 
	- stay out of the weeds 少說廢話 == Don't say too much unnecessary things.

Number nine: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said, and I'm **paraphrasing**, "If your mouth is open, you're not learning." And **Calvin Coolidge** said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job." 
	- paraphrase
		> 釋義/意譯 |Express the meaning of (something written or spoken) using different words, especially to achieve greater clarity.| you can either quote or paraphrase literary texts
		> 釋義/意譯 |A rewording of something written or spoken.| scattered here and there in the text are frank paraphrases of lines from Virgil, Cicero, and Quintilian
	- Calvin Coolidge 卡爾文·柯立芝，美國第30任總統，共和黨籍
	? No man ever listened his way out of a job 沒有人因為聽太多而被開除

Why do we not listen to each other? Number one, we'd rather talk. When I'm talking, I'm in control. I don't have to hear anything I'm not **interested** in. I'm the center of attention. I can **bolster** my own identity. But there's another reason: We get distracted. The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute. So our minds are filling in those other 275 words. And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place. 
	? The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute. So our minds are filling in those other 275 words. 一個人每分鐘平均大概會說 225 個字 但我們每分鐘可以聽進 500 個字 所以我們腦袋就會自己補上那 275 個字。

You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply." 

One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief. 

All of this **boils down** to the same basic concept, and it is this one: Be interested in other people. 
	- boil down to 歸結為 == If a situation or problem boils down to something, that is the main reason for it.
		> The problem boils down to one thing - lack of money.

You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a **ritual** in my home. People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she'd say, "Do you know who that was? She was the *runner-up* to Miss America. He was the mayor of **Sacramento**. She won a **Pulitzer Prize**. He's a Russian ballet dancer." And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them. And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed. 
	- ritual /ˈrɪtʃʊəl/ 
	- runner-up 亞軍
	- Sacramento 薩克拉門托，是一個位於美國加利福尼亞州北部、沙加緬度河流域上的城市，也是加利福尼亞州的首府

You do the same thing. Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.
