[Where is cybercrime really coming from](https://www.ted.com/talks/caleb_barlow_where_is_cybercrime_really_coming_from/transcript?referrer=playlist-who_are_the_hackers)

Cybercrime is out of control. It's everywhere. We hear about it every single day. This year, over two billion records lost or stolen. And last year, 100 million of us, mostly Americans, lost our health insurance data to thieves -- myself included. What's particularly concerning about this is that in most cases, it was months before anyone even reported that these records were stolen. 

So if you watch the evening news, you would think that most of this is **espionage** or nation-state activity. And, well, some of it is. Espionage, you see, is an accepted international practice. But in this case, it is only a small portion of the problem that we're dealing with. How often do we hear about a **breach** followed by, "... it was the result of a sophisticated nation-state attack?" Well, often that is companies not being willing to *own up* to their own **lackluster** security practices. There is also a widely held belief that by blaming an attack on a nation-state, you are *putting regulators at bay* -- at least for a period of time. 
	* espionage /ˈɛspɪənɑːʒ/ 諜報活動

		> Exercise can help keep fat at bay.

So where is all of this coming from? The United Nations estimates that 80 percent of it is from highly organized and **ultrasophisticated** criminal gangs. **To date**, this represents one of the largest illegal economies in the world, *topping out* at, now get this, 445 billion dollars. Let me put that in perspective for all of you: 445 billion dollars is larger than the GDP of 160 nations, including Ireland, Finland, Denmark and **Portugal**, *to name a few*. 
	* put (sth) in/into perspective 理解、讚揚或評估..真正的價值 == To clarify, appraise, or assess the true value, importance, or significance of something.
	- ultrasophisticated == extremely or extraordinarily sophisticated
	- top out 達到最高點 == to reach the highest point in a continuously changing level that is about to start becoming less again

So how does this work? How do these criminals operate? Well, let me tell you a little story. About a year ago, our security researchers were tracking a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated banking **Trojan** called the **Dyre** Wolf. The Dyre Wolf would get on your computer via you clicking on a link in a **phishing** email that you probably shouldn't have. It would then sit and wait. It would wait until you logged into your bank account. And when you did, the bad guys would reach in, steal your credentials, and then use that to steal your money. This sounds terrible, but the reality is, in the security industry, this form of attack is somewhat commonplace. However, the Dyre Wolf had two distinctly different personalities -- one for these small transactions, but it took on an entirely different *persona* if you were in the business of moving large-scale wire transfers. 
	- Trojan /ˈtrəʊdʒ(ə)n/ (adj)特洛伊的 (n)特洛伊人, 木馬病毒
	- phishing /ˈfɪʃɪŋ/ 網路釣魚 <--> fishing /ˈfɪʃɪŋ/ 
	- persona
		> 人格 |The aspect of someone's character that is presented to or perceived by others.| her public persona
		> 角色 |A role or character adopted by an author or an actor.|

Here's what would happen. You start the process of issuing a *wire transfer*, and up in your browser would pop a screen from your bank, indicating that there's a problem with your account, and that you need to call the bank immediately, along with the number to the bank's *fraud department*. So you pick up the phone and you call. And after going through the normal voice prompts, you're met with an English-speaking operator. "Hello, Altoro Mutual Bank. How can I help you?" And you go through the process like you do every time you call your bank, of giving them your name and your account number, going through the security checks to verify you are who you said you are. Most of us may not know this, but in many large-scale wire transfers, it requires two people to *sign off* on the wire transfer, so the operator then asks you to get the second person on the line, and goes through the same set of verifications and checks. 
	- wire transfer 電匯
	- fraud department 詐騙部門
	- sign off (on sth) 正式認可 == to approve something officially
		> Both sides signed off on a legally binding agreement last month.

Sounds normal, right? Only one problem: you're not talking to the bank. You're talking to the criminals. They had built an English-speaking *help desk*, fake overlays to the banking website. And this was so flawlessly executed that they were moving between a half a million and a million and a half dollars per attempt into their criminal coffers. 
	- help desk 客戶服務部 == a service that provides information and help to people, especially those using a computer network

These criminal organizations operate like highly **regimented**, **legitimate** businesses. Their employees work Monday through Friday. They take the weekends off. How do we know this? We know this because our security researchers see repeated spikes of malware on a Friday afternoon. The bad guys, after a long weekend with the wife and kids, come back in to see how well things went. 
	- regimented 嚴格組織的/嚴格控制的 == Very strictly organized or controlled.
	- legitimate /lɪˈdʒɪtɪmət/ 

The Dark Web is where they spend their time. That is a term used to describe the anonymous **underbelly** of the internet, where thieves can operate with anonymity and without detection. Here they **peddle** their attack software and share information on new attack techniques. You can buy everything there, from a base-level attack to a much more advanced version. In fact, in many cases, you even see gold, silver and bronze levels of service. You can check references. You can even buy attacks that come with a money-back guarantee -- if you're not successful. Now, these environments, these marketplaces -- they look like an Amazon or an eBay. You see products, prices, ratings and reviews. Of course, if you're going to buy an attack, you're going to buy from a reputable criminal with good ratings, right? 
	- underbelly
		> 下腹部 |The soft underside or abdomen of an animal.|
		> 易受攻擊的地帶 |An area vulnerable to attack.| these multinationals have a soft underbelly
		> 犯罪組織 |A hidden unpleasant or criminal part of society.| the dark underbelly of a ghetto
	- peddle
		> 兜售 |Try to sell (something, especially small goods) by going from place to place.| he peddled printing materials around the country
		> 銷贓 |Sell (an illegal drug or stolen item)| he was arrested after trying to peddle guns
		> 提倡 |Promote (an idea or view) persistently or widely.| he criticized his fellow candidate for peddling risky ideas

This isn't any different than checking on Yelp or TripAdvisor before going to a new restaurant. So, here is an example. This is an actual screenshot of a **vendor** selling malware. Notice they're a vendor level four, they have a trust level of six. They've had 400 positive reviews in the last year, and only two negative reviews in the last month. We even see things like *licensing terms*. Here's an example of a site you can go to if you want to change your identity. They will sell you a fake ID, fake passports. But note the legally binding terms for purchasing your fake ID. Give me a break. What are they going to do -- sue you if you violate them? 
	- vendor /ˈvɛndə/, /ˈvɛndɔː/
	- licensing terms 授權條款
	- licensing agreement 授權合約 

This occurred a couple of months ago. One of our security researchers was looking at a new Android malware application that we had discovered. It was called Bilal Bot. In a blog post, she positioned Bilal Bot as a new, inexpensive and beta alternative to the much more advanced GM Bot that was commonplace in the criminal underground. 

This review did not sit well with the authors of Bilal Bot. So they wrote her this very email, pleading their case and making the argument that they felt she had evaluated an older version. They asked her to please update her blog with more accurate information and even offered to do an interview to describe to her in detail how their attack software was now far better than the competition.
	? This review did not sit well with the authors of Bilal Bot. Bilal Bot 作者對此評論感到不滿
	- sit right/well (with sb) (某人)可接受/受(某人)歡迎 == to be something that you agree or are pleased with
		> Their decision/answer didn't sit well with the Board of Directors.
	
So look, you don't have to like what they do, but you do have to respect the **entrepreneurial** nature of their endeavors. 
	- entrepreneurial /ˌɒntrəprəˈnəːrɪəl/ 具有企業精神的/願意冒險的 == Characterized by the taking of financial risks in the hope of profit; enterprising.

So how are we going to stop this? It's not like we're going to be able to identify who's responsible -- remember, they operate with **anonymity** and outside the reach of the law. We're certainly not going to be able to prosecute the offenders. I would propose that we need a completely new approach. And that approach needs to be centered on the idea that we need to change the economics for the bad guys. 
	- anonymity /anəˈnɪmɪti/ 

And to give you a perspective on how this can work, let's think of the response we see to a healthcare **pandemic**: SARS, Ebola, **bird flu**, **Zika**. What is the top priority? It's knowing who is infected and how the disease is spreading. Now, governments, private institutions, hospitals, physicians -- everyone responds openly and quickly. This is a collective and altruistic effort to stop the spread in its tracks and to inform anyone not infected how to protect or **inoculate** themselves. 
	- pandemic
		> 全國流行的 |(of a disease) prevalent over a whole country or the world.|
		> 疫情 |An outbreak of a pandemic disease.| ‘the results may have been skewed by an influenza pandemic
	- Zika 茲卡病毒，是黃病毒科中之黃病毒屬，經由埃及斑蚊傳播，而使受斑蚊叮咬的人罹患茲卡病毒感染症（亦稱寨卡熱）
	- inoculate /ɪˈnɒkjʊleɪt/ 

Unfortunately, this is not at all what we see in response to a cyber attack. Organizations are far more likely to keep information on that attack to themselves. Why? Because they're worried about *competitive advantage*, **litigation** or regulation. We need to effectively **democratize** threat intelligence data. We need to get all of these organizations to open up and share what is in their private **arsenal** of information. The bad guys are moving fast; we've got to move faster. And the best way to do that is to open up and share data on what's happening. 
	- competitive advantage 競爭優勢，是一種特質，競爭力大或強的才有優勢，那麼這種優勢就是獨特的，否則它就不可能有更大或更強的競爭力
	- litigation /lɪtɪˈɡeɪʃ(ə)n/ 訴訟 == The process of taking legal action.
	- democratize
		> 使民主化 |Introduce a democratic system or democratic principles to.| public institutions need to be democratized
		> 使大眾化 |Make (something) accessible to everyone.| mass production has not democratized fashion
	* arsenal /ˈɑːs(ə)n(ə)l/ 

Let's think about this in the construct of security professionals. Remember, they're programmed right into their DNA to keep secrets. We've got to turn that thinking on its head. We've got to get governments, private institutions and security companies willing to share information at speed. And here's why: because if you share the information, it's equivalent to inoculation. And if you're not sharing, you're actually part of the problem, because you're increasing the odds that other people could be impacted by the same attack techniques. 
	? We've got to turn that thinking on its head.  我們得扭轉這樣的習性

But there's an even bigger benefit. By destroying criminals' devices closer to real time, we break their plans. We inform the people they aim to hurt far sooner than they had ever anticipated. We ruin their reputations, we crush their ratings and reviews. We make cybercrime not pay. We change the economics for the bad guys. But to do this, a first mover was required -- someone to change the thinking in the security industry overall. 

About a year ago, my colleagues and I had a *radical* idea. What if IBM were to take our data -- we had one of the largest threat intelligence databases in the world -- and open it up? It had information not just on what had happened in the past, but what was happening in near-real time. What if we were to publish it all openly on the internet? As you can imagine, this got quite a reaction. First came the lawyers: What are the legal implications of doing that? Then came the business: What are the business implications of doing that? And this was also met with a good **dose** of a lot of people just asking if we were completely crazy.

	? First came the lawyers: What are the legal implications of doing that? Then came the business: What are the business implications of doing that? And this was also met with a good dose of a lot of people just asking if we were completely crazy.  首先是律師問：「在法律上會有什麼瓜葛？」 接著是商業人士： 「在商業上會有什麼含義？」 我們還遇到許多聲音 質疑我們是不是徹底瘋了？ 
	- dose
		> 一劑/一服 |A quantity of a medicine or drug taken or recommended to be taken at a particular time.| he took a dose of cough mixture

		> 按劑量給……服藥 |Administer a dose to (a person or animal)| he dosed himself with vitamins
		> 混合 |Adulterate or blend (a substance) with another substance.| the petrol is dosed with lead

But there was one conversation that kept floating to the surface in every dialogue that we would have: the realization that if we didn't do this, then we were part of the problem. So we did something `unheard of` in the security industry. We started publishing. Over 700 terabytes of **actionable** threat intelligence data, including information on real-time attacks that can be used to stop cybercrime *in its tracks*. And to date, over 4,000 organizations are **leveraging** this data, including half of the *Fortune 100*. And our hope as a next step is to get all of those organizations to join us in the fight, and do the same thing and share their information on when and how they're being attacked as well.

We all have the opportunity to stop it, and we already all know how. All we have to do is look to the response that we see in the world of health care, and how they respond to a pandemic. Simply put, we need to be open and collaborative.
