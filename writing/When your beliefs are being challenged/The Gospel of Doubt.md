[Content]
There we were, souls and bodies packed into a Texas church on the last night [of our lives]. Packed into a room just like this, but with [creaky] wooden [pews] [draped] in [worn-down] red fabric, with an organ to my left and a [choir] at my back and a [baptism] pool built into the wall behind them. A room like this, nonetheless. With the same great feelings of [suspense], the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat in the palms and the same people in the back not paying attention.

This was December 31, 1999, the night of the Second Coming of [Christ], and the end of the world as I knew it. I had turned 12 that year and had reached the age of accountability. And once I stopped complaining about how unfair it was that Jesus would return as soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done, I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly. 
	- the Second Coming of Christ 耶穌再臨，耶穌再臨是指他在未來將回到人間。這個信仰是基於正典福音書中的彌賽亞預言

	+ get/put one's house in order 解決..的問題 == to solve your own problems
		> You should put your own house in order before you start telling me what to do!

So I went to church as often as I could. I listened for silence as [anxiously] as one might listen for noise, trying to be sure that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me and decided to come back early. And just in case he did, I built a backup plan, by reading the "Left Behind" books that were [all the rage at the time]. And I found in their pages that if I was not taken in the rapture at midnight, I had another shot. All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast, fight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself. It would be hard -- but I knew I could do it.

		> 有機會做到 |To have a chance to achieve, attain, or have success in something.| Do you really think I have a shot at winning this thing?

But planning time was over now. It was 11:50pm. We had 10 minutes left, and my [pastor] called us out of the pews and down to the altar because he wanted to be praying when midnight struck. So every faction of the [congregation] took its place. The [choir] stayed in the [choir stand], the [deacons] and their wives -- or the [Baptist Bourgeoisie] as I like to call them -- took first position in front of the [altar]. You see, in America, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section. 
	- take one's place 準備好/各就各位 == to go to the location where one is supposed to sit, stand, etc.
		> The goalie took her place on the field.

	- bourgeoisie /ˌbʊəʒwɑːˈziː/ 中產階級

And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly -- these men and women whose young backs had been [bent] under hot suns in the cotton fields of East Texas, and whose skin seemed to be burnt a [creaseless] [noble brown], just like the clay of East Texas, and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of East Texas had sometimes been bent and broken even further than their backs. Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me. They had waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their [medieval] predecessors had longed for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited for [the Oprah Winfrey Show] to come on Channel 8 every day at 4 o'clock. And as she made her way to the altar, I [snuck right in] behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother was going to heaven. And I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer, I might go right on with her. 
	- held on to

		> 緊緊抓住 |to hold something or someone firmly with your hands or your arms| Hold onto the rope and don't let go.
		> 保留/保存 |​to keep something you have| Hold on to your ticket - you'll need it later.

So I held on and I closed my eyes to listen, to wait. And the prayers got louder. And the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still. And the organ rolled on in to [add] the dirge. And the heat came on to add to the sweat. And my hand gripped [firmer], so I wouldn't be the one left in the field. My eyes [clenched] tighter so I wouldn't see the [wheat] being separated from the [chaff]. And then a voice rang out above us: "Amen."

It was over. I looked at the clock. It was after midnight. I looked at the elder believers whose savior had not come, who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now. But I was upset on their [behalf]. They had been [duped], hoodwinked, [bamboozled], and I had gone right along with them. I had prayed their prayers, I had yielded not to [temptation] as best I could. I had dipped my head not once, but twice in that [snot-inducing] [baptism] pool. I had believed. Now what? 
	- behalf

I got home just in time to turn on the television and watch [Peter Jennings] announce the [new millennium] as it rolled in] around the world. It struck me that it would have been strange anyway, for Jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zones. 
	- Peter Jennings 彼得·詹寧斯，美國廣播公司著名新聞主播，與CBS的丹·拉瑟及 NBC的湯姆·布洛考同列為美國三大新播主播

	+ It strikes me that 突然意識到 == used to say that one understands or is aware of something
		> It strikes me that there is a larger issue at stake.
		> It strikes me that so few of them were willing to help.

And this made me feel even more ridiculous -- hurt, really. But there on that night, I did not stop believing. I just believed a new thing: that it was possible not to believe. It was possible the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong. And now, where there was once a mountain of certitude, there was, running right down to its foundation, a spring of doubt, a spring that promised rivers. 

I can trace the whole drama of my life back to that night in that church when my savior did not come for me; when the thing I believed most certainly turned out to be, if not a lie, then not quite the truth. And even though most of you prepared for [Y2K] in a very different way, I'm convinced that you are here because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the [dawn] of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come. And I held out my hand, reaching for something to believe in. 
	- Y2K == Year 2000 千禧年
	- stay away 遠離某人/避開某事 == to not go near or become involved with someone; to avoid something that will have a bad effect on you

		> 抵抗/抵禦 |to continue to defend a place that is being attacked| They won't be able to hold out much longer under this sort of bombardment.

I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18, with the faith that my journey from [Oak Cliff], Texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known, the broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen. But when I found myself back home one [winter break], with my face planted in the floor, my hands tied behind my back and a [burglar's gun] pressed to my head, I knew that even the best [education] couldn't save me. 
	- burglar 入室盜竊者/竊賊 == A person who commits burglary.

I held on when I showed up at [Lehman Brothers] as an intern in 2008. So hopeful that I called home to inform my family that we'd never be poor again. But as I witnessed this temple of finance come crashing down before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me. I held on when I showed up in Washington DC as a young [staffer], who had heard a voice call out from Illinois, saying, "It's been a long time coming, but in this [election], change has come to America." But as the Congress ground to a halt and the country ripped at the [seams] and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke, I knew that even the political second coming could not save me. 
	- hold on
		> 等一下 | used to tell someone to wait for a short time| Hold on, I'll check in my diary.
		> 等一下 |used to say that you are confused or surprised by something that you have just heard or read and want to understand it| Now hold on, Ed, that wasn't what we agreed at all!

I had [knelt] faithfully at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time of success, and money, and power. But over and over again, midnight struck, and I opened my eyes to see that all of these gods were dead. And from that graveyard, I began the search once more, not because I was brave, but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die. So I took a [pilgrimage] to yet another [mecca], Harvard Business School -- this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation that it claimed to offer. No, I knew there'd be more work to do. 
	- pilgrimage /ˈpɪlɡrɪmɪdʒ/ 
		> 朝聖之旅 |A pilgrim's journey.| he wanted to go on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela
		> 朝聖 |Go on a pilgrimage.|

		> 人生 |Life viewed as a journey.| now is the thirty-first year of my dark pilgrimage on this earth
	- mecca 聖地 --> Mecca 麥加

The work began in the dark corner of a crowded party, in the late night of an early, miserable [Cambridge] winter, when three friends and I asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time: "What if we took a road trip?" 
	? when three friends and I asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time
		== when three friends and I asked a question that young folks [who were] searching for something real have asked for a very long time

We didn't know where'd we go or how we'd get there, but we knew we had to do it. Because all our lives we [yearned], as [Jack Kerouac] wrote, to "sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere," and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country. So even though there were other voices who said that the risk was too great and the proof too thin, we went on anyhow. 
	- yearn 渴望 == she yearned for a glimpse of him
	- Jack Kerouac 傑克·凱魯亞克，美國小說家、作家、藝術家與詩人，也是垮掉的一代中最有名的作家之

We went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013, through the [cow pastures] of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, through the [swamps] of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose their bottom line. And having been trained at the [West Point of capitalism], this struck us as a revolutionary idea. 
	- pasture
		> 牧草地/放牧場 |Land covered with grass and other low plants suitable for grazing animals, especially cattle or sheep.|
		> 放牧 |Put (animals) to graze in a pasture.| they pastured their cows in the water meadow

	- desolation
		> 荒地/荒蕪 |A state of complete emptiness or destruction.| the stony desolation of the desert
		> 孤寂 |Great unhappiness or loneliness.| in choked desolation, she watched him leave
	- West Point 西點軍校

And this idea spread, growing into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America, a movement that landed me here on this stage today. It spread because we found a great hunger in our generation for purpose, for meaning. It spread because we found countless [entrepreneurs] in the [nooks] and [crannies] of America who were creating jobs and changing lives and who needed a little help. 
	- nook 角落 == A corner or recess, especially one offering seclusion or security.
	- cranny 裂縫 == A small, narrow space or opening.
	+ every nook and cranny 處處/到處 == every part of a place
		> Every nook and cranny of the house was stuffed with souvenirs of their trips abroad.

But if I'm being honest, it also spread because I fought to spread it. There was no length to which I would not go to preach this gospel, to get more people to believe that we could bind the wounds of a broken country, one social business at a time. But it was this journey of [evangelism] that led me to the rather different gospel that I've come to share with you today. 
	? There was no length to which I would not go to preach this gospel 為了傳播這個福音，沒有什麼我不會做的
	- gospel /ˈɡɒsp(ə)l/ 
	- evangelism /ɪˈvan(d)ʒ(ə)lɪz(ə)m/ 福音傳道 == The spreading of the Christian gospel by public preaching or personal witness.

It began one evening almost a year ago at the Museum of Natural History in New York City, at a [gala] for [alumni] of Harvard Business School. Under a full-size replica of a whale, I sat with the [titans] of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds. There was pride in a room where [net worth] and assets under management [surpassed] half a trillion dollars. We looked over all that we had made, and it was good. 
	- gala /ˈɡɑːlə/ 節日/慶祝 == A social occasion with special entertainments or performances.
	- alumni /əˈlʌmˌnɑɪ/
	? I sat with the [titans] of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds 我坐在我們這一代的巨人旁，他們慶祝他們的優秀事蹟

But it just so happened, two days later, I had to travel up the road to Harlem, where I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a [vacant] lot, listening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids that showed up there every day. All of them lived below the [poverty] line. Many of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack to [avoid] losing them in a [homeless shelter]. Some of them came to Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, to get the only meal they had each day. Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown with money from his [pension], after 20 years as a cab driver. He told me that he didn't give himself a salary, because despite success, the program struggled for resources. He told me that he would take any help that he could get. And I was there as that help. 
	- homeless shelter 遊民收容所
	- pension /ˈpɛnʃ(ə)n/ 
		> 退休金 |A regular payment made during a person's retirement from an investment fund to which that person or their employer has contributed during their working life.|

		> 捨棄 |Discard something because it is too old or no longer wanted.| garden sheds were raided to bring out machines long since pensioned off
		> 膳宿公寓/寄宿家庭 |A small hotel or boarding house in France and other European countries.|

But as I left Tony, I felt the [sting] and salt of tears [welling] up in my eyes. I felt the weight of [revelation] that I could sit in one room on one night, where a few hundred people had [half] a trillion dollars, and another room, two days later, just 50 blocks up the road, where a man was going without a salary to get a child her only meal of the day. 
	- revelation /rɛvəˈleɪʃ(ə)n/ 
		> 被揭露的真相 |A surprising and previously unknown fact that has been disclosed to others.| revelations about his personal life

		> 天啓/啟示 |The divine or supernatural disclosure to humans of something relating to human existence.| an attempt to reconcile Darwinian theories with biblical revelation
		> 啟示錄 |The last book of the New Testament, recounting a divine revelation of the future to St John.|

And it wasn't the [glaring] [inequality] that made me want to cry, it wasn't the thought of hungry, homeless kids, it wasn't rage toward the one percent or pity toward the 99. No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized that I was the [dialysis] for a country that needed a [kidney transplant]. I realized that my story [stood in] for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps, even if they didn't have any boots; that my organization stood in for all the structural, systemic help that never went to Harlem or [Appalachia] or the Lower 9th [Ward]; that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too unlearned, too unwashed, too unaccommodated. 
	+ glaring

And the shame of that, that shame washed over me like the shame of sitting in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium again and again and again. I had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled. But this time, the false savior was me. 
	- wash over
		> 徹底地影響 |to affect or be felt by (someone) thoroughly and deeply| Just close your eyes and let the music wash over you.
		> 突然表現在臉上 |to appear on (a person's face) suddenly| A look of surprise washed over his face.

You see, I've come a long way from that altar on the night I thought the world would end, from a world where people spoke in tongues and saw suffering as a necessary act of God and took a text to be infallible truth. Yes, I've come so far that I'm right back where I started. 
	+ tongue

Because it simply is not true to say that we live in an age of disbelief -- no, we believe today just as much as any time that came before. Some of us may believe in the [prophecy] of [Brené Brown] or [Tony Robbins]. We may believe in the bible of The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review. We may believe most deeply when we worship right here at the church of TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe. We speak in the tongues of [charismatic] leaders that promise to solve all our problems. We see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god, we take the text of technological progress to be infallible truth. And we hardly realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one [brick], because we fear it might shake our whole foundation. 
	- charismatic
		> 有領袖氣質的 |Exercising a compelling charm which inspires devotion in others.| he was a charismatic figure with great appeal to the public
		> 神授的 |(of a power or talent) divinely conferred.| charismatic prophecy

But if you are disturbed by the unconscionable things that we have come to [accept], then it must be questioning time. So I have not a gospel of disruption or innovation or a triple bottom line. I do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today, in fact. I have and I offer a gospel of doubt. The gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing, it asks that you believe a new thing: that it is possible not to believe. It is possible the answers we have are wrong, it is possible the questions themselves are wrong. Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong. Because it raises the question, "Why?" With all the power that we hold in our hands, why are people still suffering so bad? 
	- unconscionable
		> 不合理的 |Not right or reasonable.| the unconscionable conduct of his son
		> 不合理地多的 |Unreasonably excessive.| shareholders have had to wait an unconscionable time for the facts to be established
	- triple bottom line 三重底線，或稱作三重盈餘，即企業盈利、社會責任、環境責任三者的統一

This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization, MBAs Across America, out of business. We have [shed] our staff and closed our doors and we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our permission. This doubt [compels] me to [renounce] the role of savior that some have placed on me, because our time is too short and our [odds] are too long to wait for second comings, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
