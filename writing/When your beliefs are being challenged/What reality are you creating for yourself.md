When Dorothy was a little girl, she was fascinated by her **goldfish**. Her father explained to her that fish swim by quickly **wagging** their tails to propel themselves through the water. Without hesitation, little Dorothy responded, "Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards by wagging their heads." 
	- wag /waɡ/ 
		> 擺動 |(especially with reference to an animal's tail) move or cause to move rapidly to and fro.| his tail began to wag
		> 擺動 |A single rapid movement from side to side.| a chirpy wag of the head
		> 搖動手指表示否定 |Move (an upwards-pointing finger) from side to side to signify disapproval.| ‘she wagged a finger at Elinor
		> 愛說笑的人 |A person who makes jokes; a joker.|

In her mind, it was a fact as true as any other. Fish swim backwards by wagging their heads. She believed it. 

Our lives are full of fish **swimming backwards**. We make assumptions and **faulty leaps of logic**. We **harbor** bias. We know that we are right, and they are wrong. We fear the worst. We strive for *unattainable* perfection. We tell ourselves what we can and cannot do. In our minds, fish swim **by in** reverse **frantically** wagging their heads and we don't even notice them. 
	- faulty

	- leap of logic
	- unattainable 不可能的 == Not able to be reached or achieved.

I'm going to tell you five facts about myself. One fact is not true. One: I graduated from Harvard at 19 with an honors degree in mathematics. Two: I currently run a construction company in Orlando. Three: I **starred** on a television **sitcom**. Four: I lost my sight to a rare genetic eye disease. Five: I served as a **law clerk** to two US Supreme Court justices. Which fact is not true? Actually, they're all true. Yeah. They're all true. 
	- honors degree 優等證書/優等學位，在北美，則是頒予成績優異的高中或大學畢業生。

At this point, most people really only care about the television show. I know this from experience. OK, so the show was NBC's "Saved by the Bell: The New Class." And I played Weasel Wyzell, who was the sort of **dorky**, **nerdy** character on the show, which made it a very major acting challenge for me as a 13-year-old boy. 
	- dorky /ˈdɔːki/ 
		> 呆頭呆腦的 |Socially inept or awkward.| he teases all the dorky kids
		> 不時髦的 |Unfashionable.| why would anyone wear such dorky glasses?

Now, did you struggle with number four, my blindness? Why is that? We make assumptions about so-called disabilities. As a blind man, I confront others' incorrect assumptions about my abilities every day. My point today is not about my blindness, however. It's about my vision. Going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open. It taught me to spot those backwards-swimming fish that our minds create. Going blind cast them into focus. 

What does it feel like to see? It's immediate and passive. You open your eyes and there's the world. Seeing is believing. Sight is truth. Right? Well, that's what I thought. 

Then, from age 12 to 25, my **retinas** progressively deteriorated. My sight became an increasingly bizarre **carnival** **funhouse** *hall* of mirrors and illusions. The salesperson I was **relieved** to spot in a store was really a **mannequin**. Reaching down to wash my hands, I suddenly saw it was a **urinal** I was touching, not a *sink*, when my fingers felt its true shape. A friend described the photograph in my hand, and only then I could see the image **depicted**. Objects appeared, **morphed** and disappeared in my reality. It was difficult and exhausting to see. I pieced together fragmented, **transitory** images, consciously analyzed the clues, searched for some logic in my crumbling **kaleidoscope**, until I saw nothing at all.

I learned that what we see is not universal truth. It is not objective reality. What we see is a unique, personal, virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain. 

Let me explain with a bit of **amateur** neuroscience. Your visual **cortex** takes up about 30 percent of your brain. That's compared to approximately eight percent for touch and two to three percent for hearing. Every second, your eyes can send your visual cortex as many as two billion pieces of information. The rest of your body can send your brain only an additional billion. So sight is **one third** of your brain by volume and can claim about two thirds of your brain's processing resources. It's no surprise then that the illusion of sight is so compelling. But make no mistake about it: sight is an illusion. 
	- cortex
		> 腦皮層 |The outer layer of the cerebrum (the cerebral cortex), composed of folded grey matter and playing an important role in consciousness.|
		> 皮層/皮質 |An outer layer of another organ or body part such as a kidney (the renal cortex), the cerebellum, or a hair.|
		> 厚皮/樹皮 |An outer layer of tissue immediately below the epidermis of a stem or root.|

Here's where it gets interesting. To create the experience of sight, your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world, other knowledge, your memories, opinions, emotions, mental attention. All of these things and far more are linked in your brain to your sight. These linkages work both ways, and usually occur **subconsciously**. So for example, what you see impacts how you feel, and the way you feel can literally change what you see. **Numerous** studies demonstrate this. If you are asked to **estimate** the walking speed of a man in a video, for example, your answer will be different if you're told to think about **cheetahs** or **turtles**. A hill appears steeper if you've just exercised, and a landmark appears farther away if you're wearing a heavy backpack. We have arrived at a fundamental contradiction. What you see is a complex mental construction of your own making, but you experience it passively as a direct representation of the world around you. You create your own reality, and you believe it. I believed mine until it broke apart. The deterioration of my eyes **shattered** the illusion. 
	- subconsciously 下意識地 == In a way that is influenced by the part of the mind of which one is not fully aware.s
	- numerous /ˈnjuːm(ə)rəs/ 
	- cheetah /ˈtʃiːtə/ 獵豹 <--> cheater /ˈtʃiːtə/ 
	- shatter /ˈʃatə/ <--> shut /ʃʌt/ 

You see, sight is just one way we shape our reality. We create our own realities in many other ways. Let's take fear as just one example. Your fears distort your reality. Under the **warped** logic of fear, anything is better than the uncertain. Fear fills the void *at all costs*, *passing off* what you dread for what you know, offering up the worst in place of the ambiguous, **substituting** assumption for reason. Psychologists have a great term for it: awfulizing. 
	- warp
		> 使變形/使彎曲 |Make or become bent or twisted out of shape, typically as a result of the effects of heat or damp.| moisture had warped the box

Right? Fear replaces the unknown with the awful. Now, fear is self-realizing. When you face the greatest need to look outside yourself and think critically, fear beats a *retreat* deep inside your mind, shrinking and distorting your view, drowning your capacity for critical thought with a flood of **disruptive** emotions. When you face a compelling opportunity to take action, fear **lulls** you into inaction, enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves. 
	- disruptive
		> 引起混亂的 |Causing or tending to cause disruption.| disruptive pupils
		> 創新的 |Innovative or groundbreaking.| breaking a disruptive technology into the market is never easy
	- lull

		> 暫時平息/暫時平靜 |A temporary interval of quiet or lack of activity.| for two days there had been a lull in the fighting

When I was diagnosed with my blinding disease, I knew blindness would ruin my life. Blindness was a death sentence for my independence. It was the end of achievement for me. Blindness meant I would live an unremarkable life, small and sad, and likely alone. I knew it. This was a fiction born of my fears, but I believed it. It was a lie, but it was my reality, just like those backwards-swimming fish in little Dorothy's mind. If I had not confronted the reality of my fear, I would have lived it. I am certain of that. 
	? If I had not confronted the reality of my fear, I would have lived it.  若我沒有正視我的恐懼， 我就會讓恐懼成真。

So how do you live your life eyes wide open? It is a learned discipline. It can be taught. It can be practiced. I will summarize very briefly. 

Hold yourself accountable for every moment, every thought, every detail. See beyond your fears. Recognize your assumptions. Harness your internal strength. Silence your internal critic. Correct your **misconceptions** about luck and about success. Accept your strengths and your weaknesses, and understand the difference. Open your hearts to your **bountiful** **blessings**. 
	- misconception 誤解 == A view or opinion that is incorrect because based on faulty thinking or understanding.

Your fears, your critics, your heroes, your villains -- they are your excuses, rationalizations, shortcuts, justifications, your surrender. They are fictions you perceive as reality. Choose to see through them. Choose to let them go. You are the creator of your reality. With that **empowerment** comes complete responsibility. 
	- empowerment
		> 權利 |Authority or power given to someone to do something.| individuals are given empowerment to create their own dwellings
		> 自主權 |The process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights.| political steps for the empowerment of women
	- With that **empowerment** comes complete responsibility. 有了這自主權， 隨之而來的是絕對的責任。 

I chose to step out of fear's tunnel into terrain uncharted and undefined. I chose to build there a blessed life. Far from alone, I share my beautiful life with Dorothy, my beautiful wife, with our **triplets**, whom we call the Tripskys, and with the latest addition to the family, sweet baby Clementine. 
	- triplet
		> 三胞胎之一 |One of three children or animals born at the same birth.| she was expecting triplets
		> 三個一組/三連音符 |A set or succession of three similar things.| a triplet of aces’
		> |An atomic or molecular state characterized by two unpaired electrons with parallel spins.|

What do you fear? What lies do you tell yourself? How do you embellish your truth and write your own fictions? What reality are you creating for yourself? 

In your **career** and personal life, in your relationships, and in your heart and soul, your backwards-swimming fish *do you great harm.* They *exact a toll* in missed opportunities and unrealized potential, and they engender insecurity and distrust where you seek fulfillment and connection. I urge you to search them out. 
	- career /kəˈrɪə/ 
	? They *exact a toll* in missed opportunities and unrealized potential  它們使你錯過機會，讓你無從發揮潛能
	- exact a toll 造成巨大的傷害 == used in phrases like exact a terrible toll and exact a high/heavy price to say that something has caused a lot of suffering, loss, etc.
	- unrealized
		> 無法實現的 |Not achieved or created.| an unrealized dream
		> 無法兌現的 |Not converted into money.| unrealized property assets

Helen Keller said that the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision. For me, going blind was a profound blessing, because blindness gave me vision. I hope you can see what I see. 

Thank you. 

Bruno Giussani: Isaac, before you leave the stage, just a question. This is an audience of *entrepreneurs*, of **doers**, of innovators. You are a CEO of a company down in Florida, and many are probably wondering, how is it to be a blind CEO? What kind of specific challenges do you have, and how do you overcome them? 
	- doer /ˈduːə/ 實踐家

Isaac Lidsky: Well, the biggest challenge became a blessing. I don't get visual feedback from people. 

BG: What's that noise there?

IL: Yeah. So, for example, in my leadership team meetings, I don't see facial expressions or gestures. I've learned to **solicit** a lot more *verbal* feedback. I basically force people to tell me what they think. And in this respect, it's become, like I said, a real blessing for me personally and for my company, because we communicate at a far deeper level, we avoid ambiguities, and most important, my team knows that what they think truly matters.
