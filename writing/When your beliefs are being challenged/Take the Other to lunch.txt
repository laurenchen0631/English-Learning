[Content]
	This room may appear to be holding 600 people but there is actually so many more, because within each one of us there is a multitude of personalities. I have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation [within] me since I was a little girl. I called them "the mystic" and "the warrior".

	I was born into a family of politically active intellectual [atheists]. There is [equation] in my family [that went] like this: if you are intelligent, you therefore [are] not spiritual. I was the freak of the family; I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the world that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our sense. I wanted to know if what we human beings see and here and think is full and accurate picture of reality.
		- atheist 無神論者

	So looking for answers, I went to [Catholic mass], I [tagged along] with my neighbors, I [read Sartre and Socrates], and then a wonderful thing happened when I was in high school. Gurus from the East started washing up on the shores of America. And I said to myself, "I wanna get me one of them." And ever since, I have been the mystic path, trying to [peer] beyond what Albert Einstein called the "optical delusion" of everyday consciousness. So what [did he mean] by this? I will show you. Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room.
		+ mass
		- tag along 跟隨/尾隨 == to go somewhere with a person or group, usually when they have not asked you to go with them
			> I don't know her, she just tagged along with us.
		- wash up
			> 洗手 |To become clean by scrubbing with soap and water, especially one's hands and face.| I've been out digging in the garden all morning, so I'd like to wash up before we go anywhere tonight.
			> 清洗 |to clean [oneself] up for something, such as a meal.| Please wash up for dinner

	Now, see this strange, underwater coral-reef-looking thing. It's actually a person's [trachea]. And those color [globe] are microbes that are actually swimming around this room, right now all around us. If we are blind to this simple biology, imagine what we are missing at the smallest [subatomic] level right now, and at the grandest cosmic level. My years at the mystic have made me question almost all my [assumption]. They have made me proud "I don't known it all." Now, when this mystic part of me [jabbers on and on] like this, the warrior rolls her eyes. She is concerned about what is happening in this world right now; she is worried; she said, "excuse me. I'm pissed off and I know a few things. We better get busy about them right now."
		- roll one's eyes 翻白眼 == to move your eyes upwards as a way of showing that you are annoyed or bored after someone has done or said something

			> International companies are all too often blind to local needs.
		- jabber (v)快而含糊地說 (n)快而含糊不清的話

			> The noise just went on and on.
		- (be) pissed off 惱火的/生氣的 == annoyed
			> He'd kept me waiting for an hour so I was pissed off to start with.
			> She seemed a bit pissed off that she hadn't been invited.

	I spent my life as a warrior, working for women's issue, working on politic campaigns, being an activist for the environment. And it can be sort of crazymaking, housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body. I've always been [attracted] to those rare people who pull that off, who devote their lives to humanity with the [grit] of the warriors and the [grace] of the mystic. People like Martin Luther King Jr who wrote "I can't never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be." "This," he wrote, "is the interrelated structure of reality." Then Mother [Teresa], another mystic warrior, who said "the problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small." And [Nelson Mandela] who lives by African concept of "ubuntu," which means "I need you in order to be me, and you need me in order to be you." Now, we all love to [trot] out these three mystic warriors [as if] they were born with a saint gene. But we all actually have the same capacity that they do. And we need to do their work now.

	I deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are [demonizing] the other by the voice we're giving to the most [divisive] among us. Listen to these titles of some of the best selling books from both side of the political [divide] here in the U.S: [Liberalism] is Mental Disorder, Rush [Limbaugh] is a Big Fat Idiot, [Pinheads] and [Patriots],Arguing with Idiots. They are supposedly [tongue-in-cheek], but they are actually dangerous. Now here is the titles that my sound familiar but whose author may surprise you: Four and a Half Years of Struggle Against Lies, [Stupidity] And Cowardice. Who wrote that? That was [Adolf Hitler]'s first title [for] [Mein Kampf] -- My struggle -- the book that launched the Nazi Party. The worst eras in human history whether in [Cambodia] or Germany or [Rwanda] they start like this with negative [otherizing]. And they [morph] into violent [extremism].

	This is why I am launching a new initiative, and it is to help all us, myself included to counteract the tendency to otherize. And I realize that we are all busy people. So don't worry. You can do this on a lunch break. I'm calling my initiative "Take the Other to Lunch". If your are a Republican, you can take a [Democrat] to lunch; Or, if you are a Democrat think of it as taking a Republican to lunch. Now, if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite, I suggest you start more local because there is no shortage of the other right in your own neighborhood. Maybe that person who worship [at the mosque] or the church or the [synagogue] down the street, or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict, or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn't believe in global warming. Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you or whose point of view makes [smoke] come out of ears.
		- Democrat (n)民主黨員
		- mosque 清真寺 /mɒsk/ == A Muslim place of worship.
		- synagogue 猶太教堂 /ˈsɪnəɡɒɡ/ == A building in which Jews meet for religious worship or instruction.

	A couple of weeks ago, I took an conservative Tea Party women to lunch. Now, on the paper she [passed] my smoking ears test. She is an activist from the Right, and I am an activist from the Left. And we used some guidelines to keep our conversation [elevated]. And you can used them too, because I know you are all going to take an other to lunch.

	So first of all, decide on a goal: To get to know one person from a group you may have negatively [stereotyped]. And before you get together, [agree] on some ground rules. My Tea Party lunch mate and I came up with these: Don't persuade, [defend], or interrupt; be curious; be conversational; be real; and listen. From there we [dove] in and we used these questions: share some of your life experiences with me; what issues deeply concerns your; and what have you always wanted to ask someone from the "other side"? My lunch partner and I came [away] with some really important [insights], and I am going to share one with you. I think it has [relevance] to any problem between people anywhere. I asked her why her side makes such [outrageous] [allegation] and lies about my side. "What?" she wanted to know. "Like we are a bunch of elitist, morally corrupt terrorist-lovers." Well, she was shocked. She thought my side beat up on her her side way more often that we called them brainless, [gun-toting] racists. An we both marveled at the label that fit none of the people we actually known. And since we have established trust, we believed in each other's [sincerity]. We agreed [we'd] speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of otherizing talk that could wound and fester into [paranoia], and then be used by those on the fringes to incite.
		- stereotyped (adj)鉛版的, 刻板的 == Viewed or represented as a stereotype.
		- outrageous

			> 過度誇張的 |Wildly exaggerated or improbable.| the outrageous claims made by the previous government
			> 令人吃驚的 |Very bold and unusual and rather shocking.| her outrageous leotards and sexy routines
		- gun-toting (adj)帶著槍的 (n)持槍 == carrying and using a gun usually for criminal purposes
		- speak up 提高嗓門/大聲點說 == to speak in a louder voice so that people can hear you
			> Could you speak up? We can't hear at the back.
		- paranoia /ˌparəˈnɔɪə/  偏執狂/多疑/罹患妄想症的人
		- on the fringes
			> 屬於 |not completely belonging to or accepted by a group of people who share the same job, activities etc| a small group on the fringes of the art world
			> 遠離 |at the part of something that is farthest from the centre| Nina remained on the fringe of the crowd.

	By the end of our lunch, we acknowledged each other's openness, neither of us had tried to change the other. But we also had pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch. Instead, we had taken fist steps together, [past our knee-jerk] reactions to the ubuntu place which is the only place where solutions to our most [intractable]-seeming problems will be found. 
		- knee-jerk 膝躍反射

	So who should you invite to lunch? Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing that will be your clue. And what might happen at your lunch? Will the heavens open and "We're the World" play over the restaurant sound system? Probably not. Because ubuntu work is slow and it is difficult. It is two people dropping the [pretense] of being [know-it-alls]. It is two people, two warriors, dropping their weapons and reaching [towards] each other. Here is how the great Persian poet [Rumi] put it: out beyond ideas of wrong-doings and right-doings, there is a field. [I'll] meet you there. 
		- pretense
