We are losing our listening. We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening, but we're not very good at it. We *retain* just 25 percent of what we hear. Now -- not you, not this talk, but that is generally true.  Let's define listening as making meaning from sound. It's a mental process, and it's a process of extraction. 
	- retain
		> 保留 |Continue to have (something); keep possession of.| Labour retained the seat
		> 維持/保持 |Not abolish or alter; maintain.| the rights of defendants must be retained
		> 記得 |Keep in one's memory.| I retained a few French words and phrases
		> 吸收/留住 |Absorb and continue to hold (a substance)| limestone is known to retain water
		> 固定 |Keep (something) in place; hold fixed.| remove the retaining bar
		> 聘/僱 |Keep (someone) engaged in one's service.| he has been retained as a freelance
		> |Secure the services of (a barrister) with a preliminary payment.| retain a barrister to handle the client's business

We use some pretty cool techniques to do this. One of them is pattern recognition. (Crowd noises) So in a **cocktail** party like this, if I say, "David, Sara, pay attention" -- some of you just sat up. We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal, and especially our name. Differencing is another technique we use. If I left this *pink noise* on for more than a couple of minutes, (Pink noise) you would **literally** cease to hear it. We listen to differences; we *discount* sounds that remain the same. 
	- cocktail /ˈkɒkteɪl/ 
		> 雞尾酒 |An alcoholic drink consisting of a spirit or spirits mixed with other ingredients, such as fruit juice or cream.| a cocktail bar
		> 混合物 |A mixture of substances or factors, especially when dangerous or unpleasant.| a cocktail of drugs with severe side effects
		> 雜錦冷盤 |A dish consisting of small pieces of food, typically served cold as a starter.|
	- pink noise 粉紅雜訊，一個具有功率譜密度與頻率成反比特徵頻譜的訊號或過程
	- discount
		> 減價 |A deduction from the usual cost of something.|
		> 貼現 |A percentage deducted from the face value of a bill of exchange or promissory |
		> 減價 |Deduct an amount from (the usual price of something)|
		> 打折 |Reduce (a product or service) in price.|
		> 貼現 |Buy or sell (a bill of exchange) before its due date at less than its maturity value.|
		> 忽視 |Regard (a possibility or fact) as being unworthy of consideration because it lacks credibility.|

And then there is a whole range of filters. These filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to. Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters. But they actually create our reality in a way, because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now. I'll give you one example of that. Intention is very important in sound, in listening. When I married my wife, I promised her I would listen to her every day as if for the first time. Now that's something I fall short of on a daily basis. But it's a great intention to have in a relationship. 
	? These filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to. 這些過濾器把我們從所有聲音中抽離出來，重點去聽我們所關注的

But that's not all. Sound places us in space and in time. If you close your eyes right now in this room, you're aware of the size of the room from the **reverberation** and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces; you're aware of how many people are around you, because of the micro-noises you're receiving. And sound places us in time as well, because sound always has time **embedded** in it. In fact, I would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future. So, "**Sonority** is time and meaning" -- a great quote. 
	- reverberation
		> 殘響 |Prolongation of a sound; resonance.| electronic effects have been added, such as echo and reverberation’
		> 反衝 |A continuing effect; a repercussion.| the attack has had reverberations around the world
	- sonority /səˈnɒrɪti/ 響亮 == The quality or fact of being sonorous.

I said at the beginning, we're losing our listening. Why did I say that? Well, there are a lot of reasons for this. First of all, we invented ways of recording -- first writing, then audio recording and now video recording as well. The **premium** on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared. Secondly, the world is now so noisy, (Noise) with this **cacophony** going on visually and **auditorily**, it's just hard to listen; it's tiring to listen. Many people take refuge in headphones, but they turn big, public spaces like this, shared **soundscapes**, into millions of tiny, little personal sound bubbles. In this **scenario**, nobody's listening to anybody. 
	- premium
		> 保險費 |An amount to be paid for a contract of insurance.|
		> 加價 |A sum added to an ordinary price or charge.| customers are reluctant to pay a premium for organic fruit
		> 紅利 |A sum added to interest or wages; a bonus.|
		> 溢價 |The amount by which the price of a share or other security exceeds its issue price, its nominal value, or the value of the assets it represents.|
		> 優質的 |Relating to or denoting a commodity of superior quality and therefore a higher price.|
		> 獎品/獎金 |Something given as a reward, prize, or incentive.| the Society of Arts awarded him a premium
	- soundscape 聲音地景 == A piece of music considered in terms of its component sounds.
	+ scenario /sɪˈnɑːrɪəʊ/
		> 情節/劇本 |A written outline of a film, novel, or stage work giving details of the plot and individual scenes.| the scenarios for four short stories
		> 事態/局面 |A postulated sequence or development of events.| a possible scenario is that he was attacked after opening the front door 
		> 背景設定 |A setting, in particular for a work of art or literature.| the scenario is World War Two

We're becoming impatient. We don't want **oratory** anymore; we want sound *bites*. And the art of conversation is being replaced -- dangerously, I think -- by personal broadcasting. I don't know how much listening there is in this conversation, which is sadly very common, especially in the UK. We're becoming **desensitized**. Our media have to **scream** at us with these kinds of headlines in order to get our attention. And that means it's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet, the subtle, the **understated**. 
	- oratory /ˈɒrət(ə)ri/
		> 小禮拜堂 |A small chapel, especially for private worship.|
		> 演講術 |The art or practice of formal speaking in public.| the gift of persuasive oratory
		> 雄辯 |Eloquent or rhetorical language.| learned discussions degenerated into pompous oratory
	- sound bite 精華片段 == soundbite == A short extract from a recorded interview or speech, chosen for its succinctness or concision.
	- desensitized
		> 不敏感的 |Having been made less sensitive.| desensitized taste buds
		> 麻木的 |Having been made less likely to feel shock or distress at scenes of cruelty or suffering by overexposure to such images.| people who view such movies become desensitized to violence
	- understated 保守的 == Presented or expressed in a subtle and effective way.

This is a serious problem that we're losing our listening. This is not trivial, because listening is our access to understanding. Conscious listening always creates understanding, and only without conscious listening can these things happen. A world where we don't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed. So I'd like to share with you five simple exercises, tools you can take away with you, to improve your own conscious listening. Would you like that? Good.

The first one is silence. Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate, so that you can hear the quiet again. If you can't get absolute silence, go for quiet, that's absolutely fine. 

Second, I call this "the *mixer*." (Noise) So even if you're in a noisy environment like this -- and we all spend a lot of time in places like this -- listen in the *coffee bar* to how many **channels** of sound can I hear? How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to? You can do it in a beautiful place as well, like in a lake. How many birds am I hearing? Where are they? Where are those ripples? It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening. 

Third, this exercise I call "**savoring**," and this is a beautiful exercise. It's about enjoying **mundane** sounds. This, for example, is my *tumble dryer*. It's a **waltz** -- one, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three. I love it! Or just try this one on for size. Wow! So, mundane sounds can be really interesting -- if you pay attention. I call that the "hidden **choir**" -- it's around us all the time. 
	- savoring /ˈseɪvə/ 
	- mundane /ˈmʌndeɪn/, /mʌnˈdeɪn/ 
	- tumble dryer 滾筒式烘乾機
	- waltz /wɔːl(t)s/
		> 華爾滋 |A dance in triple time performed by a couple, who as a pair turn rhythmically round and round as they progress around the dance floor.|
		> 圓舞曲 |A piece of music written for or in the style of a waltz.|
		> 跳華爾滋 |Dance a waltz.| I waltzed across the floor with the lieutenant
		> 輕快地走動 |Guide (someone) in or as if in a waltz.| he waltzed her round the table
		> 隨意地做 |Act casually, confidently, or inconsiderately.| you can't waltz in here and bark orders at me
		> 輕鬆辦到 |Achieve something without difficulty.| the car has waltzed through test after test
	?  Or just try this one on for size.
	- choir /ˈkwʌɪə/ <--> quiet /ˈkwʌɪət/ 

The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these, if you just take one thing away. This is listening positions -- the idea that you can move your listening position to what's appropriate to what you're listening to. This is playing with those filters. Remember I gave you those filters? It's starting to play with them as *levers*, to get conscious about them and to move to different places. These are just some of the listening positions, or scales of listening positions, that you can use. There are many. Have fun with that. It's very exciting. 接下來的練習 可能是這些最重要的，若然你只採取一樣練習。 這是聆聽的位置 -- 意思是，你可以移動你聆聽的位置 到適合你聆聽的什麼。這是把弄那些過濾器。 你還記得嗎？我開始時給你們這些過濾器。 開始將它們如槓桿般把弄， 以獲得有關它們的知覺和移動到不同的地方。這些只是一些可以使用的聆聽位置，或尺度聽的位置。 有很多。很有樂趣的。非常令人興奮。 
	- lever
		> 槓桿|A rigid bar resting on a pivot, used to move a heavy or firmly fixed load with one end when pressure is applied to the other.| a tyre lever
		> 控制桿 |A projecting arm or handle that is moved to operate a mechanism.|
		> 撬起 |Lift or move with a lever.| she levered the lid off the pot with a screwdriver
		> 移動 |Move (someone or something) with a concerted physical effort.| she levered herself up against the pillows
		> 撬起 |Use a lever.| the men levered at the coffin with crowbars
		> 手段 |A means of pressurizing someone into doing something.| rich countries use foreign aid as a lever to promote political pluralism’
		> 壓迫/迫使 |Pressurize (someone) to do something.| another sticking point is the money that will be required to lever the unions into accepting a dea

And finally, an **acronym**. You can use this in listening, in communication. If you're in any one of those roles -- and I think that probably is everybody **who's** listening to this talk -- the acronym is RASA, which is the **Sanskrit** word for "**juice**" or "essence." And RASA stands for "Receive," which means pay attention to the person; "Appreciate," making little noises like "hmm," "oh," "OK"; "Summarize" -- the word "so" is very important in communication; and "Ask," ask questions afterwards. 
	- acronym /ˈakrənɪm/ 
	- Sanskrit /ˈsanskrɪt/ (n)梵文 (adj)梵文的

Now sound is my passion, it's my life. I **wrote** a whole book about it. So I live to listen. That's too much to ask for most people. But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully -- connected in space and in time to the physical world around us, connected in understanding to each other, not to mention spiritually connected, because every spiritual path I know of has listening and **contemplation** at its heart. 
	- contemplation /ˌkɒntɛmˈpleɪʃ(ə)n/ 
		> 凝視 |The action of looking thoughtfully at something for a long time.| the road is too busy for leisurely contemplation of the scenery
		> 反思 |Deep reflective thought.| he would retire to his room for study or contemplation
		> 沉思 |The state of being considered or planned.| substantial fitting work is in contemplation
		> 冥想 |Religious meditation.|
		> |A form of Christian prayer or meditation in which a person seeks to pass beyond mental images and concepts to a direct experience of the divine.|
	? every spiritual path I know of has listening and **contemplation** at its heart. 我知道每一個精神心路上的歷程都以聆聽和沉思為核心。 

That's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill. Why is it not taught? It's crazy. And if we can teach listening in our schools, we can take our listening off that *slippery slope* to that dangerous, scary world that I talked about, and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time, or at least capable of doing it. 
	? And if we can teach listening in our schools, we can take our listening off that *slippery slope* to that dangerous, scary world that I talked about. 如果我們可以在學校里傳授傾聽技巧可以阻止我們的聽覺墜向我提到過的那個危險、可怕的世界

Now, I don't know how to do that, but this is TED, and I think the TED community is capable of anything. So I invite you to connect with me, connect with each other, take this mission out. And let's get listening taught in schools, and transform the world in one generation to a conscious, listening world -- a world of connection, a world of understanding and a world of peace. 

Thank you for listening to me today
