The electron microscope is so named because it directs a beam of electron rather than light through a specimen. The beam of electron is created in a hot tounsten philerment in an electron gun. This beam then travels through the length of the microscope cylinder which houses the lenses, the specimen chamber, and the image-recording system. Two types of electron lenses are used: a electrostatic and electromagnetic. They create a electric and electromagnetic field to both concentrate and move the beam.

The electron microscope requires that the electron beam be in a vacuum, because electrons cannot travel far in air at atmosphere pressure. The column and specimen chamber of the electron microscope are evacuated by pumps. Living specimens cannot be examined with an electron microscope, since they would not survive in a vacuum. The magnification and magnetic electron microscope is determined by the strength of current passing through the electric and electromagnetic lens coils. The image is focused by changing the current through the objective lens coil. In the optical microscope the image is determined by absorption of light by the specimen. In the electron microscope the image is resolved from the scattering of electrons by atoms of the specimen. Since atom with high atomic numbers scatters electron more than does light atom, it appears darker. As been passed through specimen, each tiny variation in the structure of specimen causes a variation in electron stream that image produced is then projected onto ?? screen or recorded on film. The electron microscope, with tremendous resolving power, can magnify specimen over 50,000 times.

The electron microscope is so named because it directs a beam of electrons rather than light through a specimen. The beam of electrons is created in a hot tungsten filament in an electron gun.

Two types of electron lenses are used, electrostatic and electromagnetic. They create electric and electromagnetic fields to concentrate and move the beam.

As the beam passes through a specimen, each tiny variation in the structure of the specimen causes a variation in the electron stream. The image produced is then projected onto a fluorescent screen or recorded on film. The electron microscope, with its tremendous resolving power, can magnify specimens over 50,000 times.
