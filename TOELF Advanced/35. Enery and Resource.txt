The earth's crust consists of a relatively thin layer of rock lying above the mantle, a region of high temperatures and pressures. Geologists call the rate of increase the "geothermal gradient", and measure it in degrees per unit of depth.

The geothermal gradient varies from place to place but it is usually higher in crust beneath the sea than thicker continental crust. Engineers can exploit the heat wherever they can reach it.

Geothermal energy schemes go back thousands of years. Reservoirs of hot water can lie close to surface where local geological conditions allow. Such reservoirs occur in permeable rocks most commonly in seismically active regions. This often close the boundaries of coastal plates, for example in Iceland, New Zealand, and Italy. Converting energy to the electricity is also not a new idea. The first generator driven by geothermal steam began operating in Italy in 1904. Today geothermal power plants around the world have a capacity of more than two thousands megawatts. Together with geothermal projects that supply only warmth for space heating rather than electricity generation, this adds up to at least ten thousand megawatts of geothermal energy already in use. Engineers could extract more of this heat if they could find ways to drill economically through impermeable rock to depth which temperatures are high enough. In the development project run by Britain Central Electricity Generating Board in Conwil in Southwest England, the geothermal gradient is normal, but decaying radioactive elements give the rocks extra heat.

Geothermal energy schemes go back thousands of years. Reservoirs of hot water can lie close to the surface where local geological conditions allow. Such reservoirs occur in permeable rocks, most commonly in seismically active regions. These are often close to the boundaries of crustal plates, for example in Iceland, New Zealand and Italy. Converting the energy to electricity is also not a new idea. The first generators driven by geothermal steam began operating in Italy in 1904. Today, geothermal power plants around the world have a capacity of more than two thousand megawatts. Together with geothermal projects that supply only warmth for space heating rather than electricity generation, this adds up to at least 10,000 MW of geothermal energy already in use. Engineers could extract more of this heat if they could find ways to drill economically through impermeable rock to depth at which temperatures are high enough. In a development project run by Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board in Cornwall in South-West England, the geothermal gradient is normal, but decaying radioactive elements give the rocks extra heat.
