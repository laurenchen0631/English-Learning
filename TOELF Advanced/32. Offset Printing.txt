[Listened Article]
In the past few decades offset printing (also called offset lithography) has replaced letterpress and intaglio methods almost entirely for commercial work. The name "offset" refers to the fact that the printing plates do not come into direct contact with paper. Instead, the ink printing plates which are attached to a cylinder transfer or offset the image to a rubber blanket covering another cylinder. As the inked blanket cylinder rotates, it deposits the image onto the paper which is fed from another set of rollers.

The offset technique was made possible at beginning of the 20th century after the development of the certain photographic processes and the rotery webfet press. Offset printing plates are usually made of steel, aluminum or a chrome caper alloy.

Unlike letterpress or intaglio printing, offset does not depend on raised or etched surfaces to transfer images. Instead, it relies on the fact that grease and water do not mix. As the plate cylinder rotates, the plate pass first under water-sop damping rollers and then under inking rollers that carry a grease-based ink. The offset plate is chemically treated so that the area to which the ink is transferred retains the greasy ink and repels water. The rest of the plate retains water and repels ink. As the cylinder continue to rotate, the plate presses against the rubber blanket which accept ink from the plate and transfer it to the paper. Since there is no type to wear out, an offset plate can make a large number of impressions. Offset presses can be designed to print both sides of the paper at once and to reproduce images with one or more colors.
