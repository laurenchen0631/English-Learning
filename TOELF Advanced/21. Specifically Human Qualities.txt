The first element which differentiates human from animal existence is negative one: the relatively absence in man of instinctive regulation in the process of adaption to the surrounding world. The mode of adaption of the animal to its world remains the same throughout. If its instinctive equipment is no longer fit to cope successfully with a changing environment, this species will become extinct. The animal can adapt itself to changing conditions by changing itself. In this fashion it lives harmoniously not in a sense of absence of struggle, but in a sense that its inherited equipment makes a fixed and unchanging part of its world. It either fits in or dies out.

The less complete and fixed instinctive equipment of the animals, the more developed is the brain and therefore ability to learn. The emergence of man can be defined as occurring at the point in the process of evolution where instinctive adaption has reached its minimum. But he emerges with new qualities which differentiate him from the animal: his awareness of himself as separate entity, his ability to remember the past, to visualize the future, and to denote objects and acts by symbols, and his reason to conceive and understand the world. Man is the most helpless of all animals, but this very biological weakness is the basis for his strength, the prime cost for the development of his specifically human qualities.
