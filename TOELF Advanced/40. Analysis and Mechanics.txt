The scientific revolution had bequeathed to mathematics a major program of research in analysis and mechanics. The period from 1700 to 1800, "the century of analysis", witnessed the consolidation of the calculus and its extensive application to mechanics. With expansion came specialization as different part of the subject acquire their own identity, ordinary and partial differential acquisition, calculus variation, inf?? theory, and differential geometry. The applications of analysis were also varied, including the theory of the vibrating string, particle dynamics, the theory of rigid bodies, the mechanics of flexible and elastic media, and the theory of compressible and incompressible fluids. Analysis and mechanics developed in close association with problem in one giving rise to concept and technique in the other, and all the leading mathematicians of the period made important contribution to mechanics. 

The close relationship between mathematics and mechanics in the 18th century had rooted extending deep into the enlightment thought. In the organization chart of knownledge at the beginning of preliminary discourse to the incycle PD. Downbear distinguished between pure mathematics (geometry, araismatic, algebra, calculus) and mixed mathematics (mechanics, geometry stranomy, optics, outercongesturing). Mathematics generally was classified as science of nature and separated from logic, a science of men. The modern disciplinary division between physics and mathematics and the association of the latter with logic had not yet developed.

The period from 1700 to 1800, "The century of analysis," witnessed the consolidation of the calculus and its extensive of application to mechanics. With expansion came specialization, as different parts of the subject acquired their own identity: ordinary and partial differential equations, calculus of variations, infinite series, and differential geometry. The applications of analysis were also varied, including the theory of the vibrating string, particle dynamics, the  theory of rigid bodies, the mechanics of flexible and elastic media, and the theory of compressible and incompressible fluids. Analysis and mechanics developed in close association, with problems in one giving rise to concepts and techniques in the other, and all the leading mathematicians of the period made important contributions to mechanics.

The close relationship between mathematics and mechanics in the 18th century had roots extending deep into Enlightenment thought, In the organizational chart of knowledge at the beginning of the preliminary discourses to the Encyclopedie, d`Alembert distinguished between "pure" mathematics (geometry, arithmetic, algebra, calculus) and "mixed" mathematics (mechanics, geometric astronomy, optics, art of conjecturing). Mathematics generally was classified as a "science of nature" and separated from logic, "a science of man." The modern disciplinary division between physics and mathematics and the association of the latter with logic had not yet developed.
