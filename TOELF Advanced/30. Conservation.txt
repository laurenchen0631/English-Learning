In the 1980s a number of wildlife biologists and conservation groups fostered a movement to restore the great wolf to Yellowstone National Park. In the late 19th century, wolves were considered a new scene by park visitors. Hunters would often poison the carcass of a downed elk in attempt to decrease the wild canine population. A bounty was placed on wolves by the government, and by the 1920s the population was eliminated. Their reintroduction program was strongly protested by local ranchers who claimed that the animals would decimate area livestock. Despite the protest, the wolf restoration program began in 1995 with the release of 33 Canadian wolves into the park.

The wolf population thrived in their new home with a population at the end of 1997 numbering approximately 97 and continuing to grow. In only two years after the wolves were transported from Canada to Wileomin Park, they reduced Yellowstone coyote population by almost 50 percent. In doing so, the wolves made a dramatic and beneficial impact on wildlife biodiversity in Yellowstone. In the absence of the wolves, coyotes had been the top predators in the ecosystem at the top of the local food chain along with the ?? bears. Their population had grown large but remained extremely stable. Part of reason for the coyotes' decline after the wolves were reintroduced may be territorial shifts - some of coyotes may have simply move out of Yellowstone. But the main reason for the downsize coyote population was probably death at jaws of the wolves. The decreased coyote population was a boon for rodent species, such as ground squirrels, vos, and pocket golfers which constituted most of the coyote diet.
