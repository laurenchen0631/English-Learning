A major interest of criminologists is correction, what should be done with a criminal once he has been caught, trialed, and convicted. Until well into the 19th century, penalties consisted primarily of public humiliation, beatings or torture, banishment or exile, death, fines, or confiscation of property. Imprisonment as a penalty became common after the 16th century but only for lesser offenses.

Not until the late 19th century, did imprisonment become the most common penalty for most crimes. This resulted in great part from the work of criminologists who persuaded societies against the uselessness of other punishments. Gradually the purpose of imprisonment began to shift from confinement to attempts to turn prisoner away from the life of crime when they were released. Prisons for young offenders, the first which was established at Emiron, New York in 1876, were called reformatories. They gave great emphasis to education for their inmates.

Probably the most significant correctional development of the late 19th century were probation and parole. Under probation the sentence of a selected convicted criminal is suspended if the criminal promises to behave well, except some supervision in his life, and meets certain specific requirements. Parole involves conditional release from confinement after part of sentence has already been served. It is granted only if the prisoner seems to have changed into a honest and trustworthy person.
