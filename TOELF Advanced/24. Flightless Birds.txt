Certain birds whose ancient relatives once flew have lost the power of flight and have adapted to other modes of living. The large such group of birds called ratites includes ostrich, rhea, emu, cassowary, and kiwi. Two extinct ratites are the elephant bird and the moa. Unrelated to the ratites are the penguin whose flip-like wings help it to swim and the extinct dodo.

According to theory, birds are descended from sudosuchians, reptiles that began to live in trees about 225 million years ago. With passage of time, the scales on the bodies of these reptiles are believed to have evolved into feathers. This was accompanied by the gradual modification of forelimbs into membranous wings, making it possible for these animals possible to live from trees and glide to the ground. From these reptiles, archeopetrx (ancient wings) evolved. According to theory, this warm-blooded animal could use its wing to rise up and move through the air. Archeopetrx, the first true bird, probably appeared some 136 million years ago. 

If all birds are descended from archeopetrx, where then do flightless birds come from? This question has puzzled scientists for a long time. Some suggest that modern birds have two common ancestors instead of one. The first line of descent, representing majority, attained flight long ago.

The other line, flightless bird, is at an early stage of evolution. Most experts reject this view today. They say that flightless birds have flying ancestors but lost the use of their wings because they did not need them to survive.

The largest such group of birds, called the ratites, includes the ostrich, rhea, emu, cassowary, and kiwi. Two extinct reptiles are the elephant bird and the moa. Unrelated to the ratites are penguin,, whose flipperlike wings help it to swim, and the extinct dodo.

According to theory, birds are descended from pseudosuchians, reptiles that began to live in trees about 225 million years ago. With the passage of time, the scales on the bodies of these reptiles are believed to have evolved into feathers. This was accompanied by the gradual modification of the forelimbs into membranous wings, making it possible for these animals to leap from trees and glide to the ground. From these reptiles, Archaeopteryx ("ancient wings") evolved. According to theory, this warm-blooded animal could use its wings to rise up and move through the air. Archaeopteryx, the first true bird, probably appeared some 136 million years ago.

If all birds are descended from Archaeopteryx, where then do flightless birds come from? This question has puzzled scientists for a long time. Some suggest that modern birds have two common ancestors instead of one. The first line of descent, representing the majority, attained flight long ago.

The other line, flightless birds, is at an early stage of evolution. Most experts reject this view today. They say that flightless birds had flying ancestors but lost the use of their wings because they did not need them to survive.
