All motion pictures are based on an illusion of motion made possible by a characteristic of visual perception called persistence of vision. The brain retains an impression for 1/16 to 1/10 of a second after the eye have stopped looking at an illuminated image. When a series of pictures of an object is presented in steady, rapid succession with the position of the object slightly alter in each picture to represent successive stages of movement, the brain blends the different pictures into one another, creating the illusion of motion.

A simple way to demonstrate the illusion of motion is to draw a line in the lower-right-hand corner of each page of ? of paper, altering the angle of each line very slightly in a single direction. If the pages are then riffled at rather fast pace, the eye would perceive the illusion of a moving line.

In motion pictures, persistence of vision is used to create the illusion of motion from still photographs. By means of a shutter that open and close at high speed, the motion picture camera photographs a series of still images. Because the time lapse between images is normally 1/24 of a second in most cameras, the differences between images are small. The illusion of motion is provided by the projector in which the film is moved past the light source at the same speed at which the images were photographed. Persistence of vision cause the separate images to be projected as a continuously moving scene. If there were no separate between images, the picture would appear as a blur.
