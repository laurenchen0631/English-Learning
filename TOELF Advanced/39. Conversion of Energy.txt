Beginning in the year 1840, James Joule performed a long series of experiments to study the conversion of mechanical energy to heat. In one experiment, he used a barrel to heat water by rotating a paddle wheel inside the barrel. He measured the work done in turning the wheel and he produced in the water, and found that a given amount of work always produce the same amount of heat. Later experiments showed that heat and mechanical energy are always converted back and forth and precisely the same ratio. We now know that the same rule is true for all forms of energy. In everyday terms, energy is never lost. When it disappears in one form, it always shows up in an equal amount in another form. This principle - known as the law of conservation of energy - is one of the fundamental laws of classical physics, and is very cornerstone of modern science and technology.

When it comes to the subject of energy, we should understand why a nation like the United States cannot solve its energy problems by operating automobiles on electricity instead of gasoline. It should be clear by now that electrical energy is no easier to come by than chemical energy in gasoline. Neglecting engine efficiency for the moment, it takes the same amount of energy to move an automobile a given distance regardless of the initial source of that energy. If all our autos ran on electricity, that energy could be supplied only by burning additional fossil or nuclear fuels at our electricity generating plants. It is true, of course, that electrical motors are more efficient than gasoline engines, but this advantage might well be offset by the weight of batteries to be carried about.
