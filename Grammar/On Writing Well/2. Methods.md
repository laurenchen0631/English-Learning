## Unity
- The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number if words on a regular basis.
- Unity of pronoun: first person, third person or second person.
- Unity tense: choose the tense in which you are *principally* going to address the reader.
- Unity of mood: any tone is acceptable, but do not mix two or more.
- Ask some following, basic questions:
	1. How much do I want to cover?
	1. What one point do I want to make?
- There is no infinite time to write a book; therefore, think small and decide what corner of your subject to be covered well and stop.
- Every successful piece of nonfiction should leave readers with **one and only one provocative thought**.
- Do not become the prisoner of a preconceived plan. Writing is no respecter of blueprint. In other words, go back to the beginning and rewrite it so that your mood and your style are consistent.

## The Lead and the Ending
- The most important sentence in an article is the first one. The second is less important than the first one, and then third one is less than the second one. And go on.
- There is no definite answer of how long a leading should be.
- Coax the reader a little more; keep him inquisitive.
- **Every paragraph should amplify the one that preceded it**. Give more thought to adding solid detail and less to entertaining the reader.
- You should always collect more material than you will use.
- Try to give your lead a freshness of perception or detail. Sometimes, to just tell a story is an available lead. Sometimes, you can tell your whole story in the first sentence.
- You should give as much thought to choosing your last sentence as you did to your first.
- The positive reason for ending well is that a **good last sentence/paragraph is a joy in itself**. It **gives the reader a lift or surprise**, and it lingers when the article is over.
- What usually works best as an ending is a **quotation**. Go back through your notes to** find some remark that has a sense of finality, or that’s funny, or that adds an unexpected closing detail.**

## Bits & Pieces
- Verbs
	- Use active verbs unless there is no comfortable way.
	- Active verbs leaves no doubt on the action of a sentence.
	- Short is better than long.
	- Don’t choose one that is dull or merely serviceable. **Make active verbs activate your sentences, and avoid the kind that need an appended preposition to complete their work.**
- Adverbs
	- Most adverbs are unnecessary.
	- You will clutter your sentence and annoy the reader *if you choose a verb that has a specific meaning and then add an adverb that carries the same meaning.*
	- Strong verbs are weakened by redundant adverbs. So are adjectives and other parts of speech: “effortlessly easy,” “slightly spartan,” “totally flabbergasted.”
- Adjective
	- Most adjectives are also unnecessary, like adverbs.
	- the rule is simple: make your adjectives do work that needs to be done.
- Little Qualifiers
	- Prune out **the small words that qualify how you feel** and how you think and what you saw: “a bit,” “a little,” “sort of,” “kind of,” “rather,” “quite,” “very,” “too,” “pretty much,” “in a sense”, and so on.
