## Unity
- The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number if words on a regular basis.
- Unity of pronoun: first person, third person or second person.
- Unity tense: choose the tense in which you are *principally* going to address the reader.
- Unity of mood: any tone is acceptable, but do not mix two or more.
- Ask some following, basic questions:
	1. How much do I want to cover?
	1. What one point do I want to make?
- There is no infinite time to write a book; therefore, think small and decide what corner of your subject to be covered well and stop.
- Every successful piece of nonfiction should leave readers with **one and only one provocative thought**.
- Do not become the prisoner of a preconceived plan. Writing is no respecter of blueprint. In other words, go back to the beginning and rewrite it so that your mood and your style are consistent.

## The Lead and the Ending
- The most important sentence in an article is the first one. The second is less important than the first one, and then third one is less than the second one. And go on.
- There is no definite answer of how long a leading should be.
- Coax the reader a little more; keep him inquisitive.
- **Every paragraph should amplify the one that preceded it**. Give more thought to adding solid detail and less to entertaining the reader.
- You should always collect more material than you will use.
