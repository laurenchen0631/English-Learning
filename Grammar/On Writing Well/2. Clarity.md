## Clarity

1. A good writing means the sentences consist of only its cleanest components.
2. A word that serve no function, a unnecessarily long word, an adverb that repeats the meaning of an already written verb and a passive sentence, all of these, weaken the strength of a sentence.
3. Writers must therefore constantly ask: what am I trying to say? The clear writer is someone clearheaded enough to see this stuff for what it is: fuzz.

## Clutter
1. Take the adjective “personal,” as in “a personal friend of mine,” “his personal feeling” or “her personal physician.” Physicians are physicians, friends are friends. The rest is clutter.
2. Clutter is intentionally used to hide the mistakes.
3. Beware of the **long word that’s no better than the short** word: “assistance” (help), “numerous” (many), “facilitate” (ease), “individual” (man or woman), “remainder” (rest), “initial” (first), “implement” (do), “sufficient” (enough), “attempt” (try), “referred to as” (called)
