## Essay
Some people argue as if it is a general truth that technology have a negative effect on children's creativeness. As far as I am concerned, I disagree with the argument. Some reasons justifies why I think technology makes children more creative than in the past, and I would explore a few of the most important ones here.

To begin with, technology makes more original ideas to be explored. One of the most influential effect of state-of-the-art technology is the efficiency of spreading information. Modern people only tap a few times in their computer and cellphone, and then they find the things they want, such as commodities recommended by advertising. For example, nowadays a lot of websites are builded to promote their unprecedented design online and some of them look for patronage. Every day hundreds of new concepts are born worldwide, and, unfortunately, competitions among these concepts become more intensive than in the past. Not only do enormous ideas occur through the world, but also some inferior thought are exterminated by accelerated contest for capital. When it comes to the whole world, contemporary children absolutely seem more derivative than only in a region or a continent.

Secondly, with the advancement of technology some traditional reinvention are ignored. Business competitions force the products to be unique. Otherwise, the products are not able to stand in the spotlight. For example, a manufacturer who produces a cellphone whose weight is lighter than other products on the market and original operating system provide a smooth experience and longer battery life. Most of people, no doubt, don't take any consideration on this cellphone. On the other hand, they pick products from Apple, Google, and Samsung in that they are more renowned and popular. If there are massive advertisements about the new cellphone and its innovative features, they might become more salient and creative. However, are advertisements analogous to creativeness? In short, being that people ignore and contempt small creations, people feel that inventions become less and less.

Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that creativeness of children have not declined. It is due half to the surge of competitions among the whole world and half to care only for famous companies' products. These factors generate a fake semblance that children don't create things anymore.

## Review
Some people argue as if it is a general truth that technology *has* a negative effect on children's creativeness. As far as I am concerned, I disagree with the argument. Some reasons justifies why I think technology makes children more creative than in the past, and I would explore a few of the most important ones here.

To begin with, technology makes more original ideas to be explored. One of the most influential effect of state-of-the-art technology is the efficiency of spreading information. *With only a few taps on the computer and the cellphone,* they find the things they want, such as commodities recommended by advertising. For example, nowadays a lot of websites are builded to promote their unprecedented design online and some of them look for patronage. Every day hundreds of new concepts are born worldwide, and, unfortunately, competitions among these concepts become more *drastic* than in the past. Not only do enormous ideas occur through the world, but also some inferior thoughts are exterminated by accelerated *competition* for capital and funding. When it comes to the whole world, contemporary children absolutely seem more derivative than *compared* only in a region or a continent.

Secondly, with the advancement of technology some traditional reinvention are ignored. Business *competition* force the products to be unique. Otherwise, the *inventions* are not able to *stand in the spotlight*. For example, a manufacturer who produces a cellphone whose weight is lighter than other products on the market and original operating system *provides* a smooth experience and longer battery life. Most of people, no doubt, *don't directly take this cellphone into consideration*. On the other hand, people pick products from Apple, Google, and Samsung in that they are more renowned and popular. If there are massive advertisements about the new cellphone and its innovative features, they might become salient and creative to those people. However, do advertisements represent creativeness? In short, being that people ignore and contempt small creations, people feel that inventions *from modern generation* become less and less.

Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that creativeness of children have not declined. It is due half to the surge of competitions among the whole world and half to care only for famous companies' products. These factors generate a *forged* semblance that *children own less inventiveness*.
