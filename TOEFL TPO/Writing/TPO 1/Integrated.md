## Essay
The reading and the lecture discuss about the effect of having four-day workweek compared to traditional working hours. The author of the reading feels that the new working hours benefits from three different perspectives. However, the lectures challenges the claims made by the author. He is of the opinion that the new policy of the workweek negatively impinge instead.

To begin with, the authors argues that the shortened workweek leads to fewer errors of the employees and, hence, enhance profits. This specific argument is challenged by the lecturer. He claims that the profit could decline even if the errors decreases. Additionally, he also says that decreased workweek causes the increasing of the new employees which still needs some equipment[s], such as computer, training programs, and more space notwithstanding they appear with fewer times than the others.

Secondly, the writer suggests that it would reduce unemployment rates. In the article, it is said that with fewer workweeks, companies can hire more employ to handle the rest of workload, which leads to reduced unemployment rats. The lecturer, in contrast, rebuts this by mentioning the expectation of the companies. He elaborates this by bringing up the point that the owner or shareholders of the company expect those four-day employees to achieve the same outcome as those five-day ones. In short, company will not hire someone new, which means unemployed rates may not alter.

Finally, the author posits that four-day workweek could improve the quality of those employees. Moreover, it is stated in the article that the added resting time is spent with their families or by pursuing interests. On the contrary, the lecturer's position is that it could risk and even lower the quality of life. He notes that those employees, compared to the ones working five days a week, are more likely to lose their jobs and have lesser opportunity to get promoted.

The reading and the lecture *are both* about the effect of having four-day workweek compared to traditional working hours. The author of the reading feels that the new working hours benefits from three different perspectives. However, the lectures challenges the claims made by the author. He is of the opinion that the new policy of the workweek negatively *impact* instead.

To begin with, the authors argues that the shortened workweek leads to fewer errors of the employees and, hence, enhance profits. This specific argument is challenged by the lecturer. He claims that the profit could decline even if the errors decreases. Additionally, he also says that decreased workweek causes *the increased number of* the employees which still needs *new* *equipment*, such as computer, training programs, and ~~more~~ space notwithstanding they appear with fewer times than the others.

Secondly, the writer suggests that it would reduce unemployment rates. In the article, it is said that with fewer workweeks companies can hire more *employees* to handle the rest of workload; *and eventually it* reduce unemployment *rates*. The lecturer, in contrast, rebuts this by mentioning the expectation of the companies. He elaborates this by bringing up the point that the owner or shareholders of the company expect those four-day employees to achieve the same *performance* as those five-day ones *by working overtime*. In short, company will not hire someone new, which means unemployed rates may not alter.

Finally, the author posits that four-day workweek could improve the *life qualities* of those employees. Moreover, it is stated in the article that the *additional time* is spent with their families or by pursuing interests. On the contrary, the lecturer's position is that it could risk and even lower the quality of life. He notes that those employees, compared to the ones working five days a week, are more likely to lose their jobs and *to* have lesser opportunity getting promoted *to earn more salary which may boost their life qualities further*.

## Lecture

## Phrase
In the United States, employees typically work five days a week for eight hours each day. However, many employees want to work a four-day week and are willing to accept less pay in order to do so. A mandatory policy requiring companies to offer their employees the option of working a four-day workweek for four-fifths (80 percent)of their normal pay would benefit the economy as a whole as well as the individual companies and the employees who decided to take the option.

The shortened workweek would increase company profits because employees would feel more rested and alert, and as a result, they would make fewer costly errors in their work. Hiring more staff to ensure that the same amount of work would be accomplished would not result in additional payroll costs because four-day employees would only be paid 80 percent of the normal rate. In the end, companies would have fewer overworked and error-prone employees for the same money, which would increase company profits.

For the country as a whole, one of the primary benefits of offering this option to employees is that it would reduce unemployment rates. If many full-time employees started working fewer hours, some of their workload would have to be shifted to others. Thus, for every four employees who went on an 80 percent week, a new employee could be hired at the 80 percent rate.

Finally, the option of a four-day workweek would be better for individual employees. Employees who could afford a lower salary in exchange for more free time could improve the quality of their lives by spending the extra time with their families, pursuing private interests, or enjoying leisure activities.
