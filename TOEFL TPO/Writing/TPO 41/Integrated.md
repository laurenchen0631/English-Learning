## Essay
The reading and the lecture are both about the need for a new, stricter regulations for handling and storing coal ash. The author of the reading feels that some reasons cause power companies to oppose the regulation, whereas the lecturer challenges the claims made by the author. In short, she is of the opinion that new regulation must be enacted.

To begin with, the author contends that some similar regulation has already existed for a while. The article mentions that the old regulation orders the companies to use liner to prevent the coal ash from leaking into the soil. The specific argument is challenged by the lecturer who claims that the ancient regulation is not sufficient especially for many old companies. Additionally, she says that the regulation actually works only in newer companies, but, on the other hand, the old companies still cause some damage to the environment like contaminating the drinking water.

Secondly, the writer suggests that the rule indirectly decline the willing of people to buy the products which are made by recycling coal ash. In the article, it is said that, if the strict regulations are active, people may feel that the substance is harmful and avoid buying them. The lecturer, however, rebuts this by remarking that the regulation do not affect the opinion about the products. Furthermore, she elaborates on this by bringing up the point that mercuary, which is dangerous substance and is carefully stored and handled, are still being recycled to some products which people still buy for fifteen years.

Finally, the author posits that the regulations lead the cost of power to arise. Moreover, it is stated in the article that the companies eventually elevate the price of electricity due to the cost in disposal and handling coal ash. In contrast, the lecturer's position is that the cost of executing stricter regulations are worthy. She notes that the average price of electricity only increase by one percent even though estimated whole amount rise by fifteen billion dollars.

Secondly, the writer suggests that the rule indirectly *discourage* people to buy the products which are made by recycling coal ash. In the article, it is said that, if the strict regulations are active, people may feel that the substance is harmful and avoid buying *corresponding products*. The lecturer, however, rebuts this by remarking that the regulation do not affect the opinion about the products. Furthermore, she elaborates on this by bringing up the point that *mercury*, which is dangerous substance and is carefully stored and handled, are still being recycled to manufacture some products which people still buy for *several* years.

Finally, the author posits that the regulations lead the cost of power *companies* to *enlarge*. Moreover, it is stated in the article that the companies eventually elevate the price of electricity which are concerned by people due to the cost in disposal and handling coal ash. In contrast, the lecturer's position is that the cost of executing stricter regulations are worthy. She notes that the average price of electricity **per house** only increase by one percent even though *the* estimated whole amount rise by fifteen billion dollars.

## Passage
Burning coal in power plants produces a waste product called coal ash, a material that contains small amounts of potentially harmful chemicals. Environmentalists in the United States are concerned about the damage such harmful chemicals may be doing to the environment and suggest that the United States government should create new, much stricter regulations for handling and storing coal ash.

However, representatives of power companies take the opposite view: they argue that new regulations are unnecessary and might actually have negative consequences. They use the following arguments to support their position.

Regulations Exist

First, power company representatives point out that effective environmental regulations already exist. For example, one very important regulation requires companies to use liner—special material that prevents coal ash components from leaking into the soil and contaminating the surrounding environment. Companies that dispose of coal ash in disposal ponds or landfills must use liner in every new pond or landfill they build.

Concerns About Recycling Coal Ash

Second, some analysts predict that creating very strict rules for storing and handling coal ash might discourage the recycling of coal ash into other products. Currently, a large portion of coal ash generated by power plants is recycled: it is used, for example, in building materials such as concrete and bricks. Recycling coal ash reduces the need to dispose of it in other ways and presents no environmental danger. However, if new, stricter rules are adopted for handling coal ash, consumers may become concerned that recycled coal ash products are just too dangerous, and may stop buying the products.

Increased Cost

Finally, strict new regulations would result in a significant increase in disposal and handling costs for the power companies—perhaps as much as ten times the current costs. Power companies would be forced to increase the price of electricity, which would not be welcomed by the general public.

## Lecture
Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about. 

There should definitely be stricter rules adopted for handling and disposing of coal ash.

First, the regulations we have now, for example those that require companies to use liner, **are not really sufficient**. Under the current regulations, **liner has to be used only when a company builds a new landfill or a new pond.** But companies are not required to add liner to old ponds and landfills. Yet several of those **older disposal sites have caused significant damage—for example, the harmful chemicals from coal ash leaked into groundwater and contaminated drinking water.** We absolutely need stricter new regulations that will prevent environmental damage at all coal ash disposal sites—the new sites as well as the old ones.

Second, stricter rules for handling coal ash **won't necessarily mean that consumers will stop using recycled coal ash products.** Let's look at how people responded to strict regulations for other dangerous materials. **Take mercury, for example.** Mercury is a fairly hazardous material, and it's been **subject to very strict handling and storage rules** for a long time. Yet despite those rules, it's been successfully and **safely recycled for over 50 years and consumers have had very few concerns about it**! So it's unlikely that consumers will become afraid to buy recycled coal ash products if stricter regulations are adopted.

Third, it's true that the cost of coal ash storage and handling will increase. But in this case, **the result is well worth the extra cost**. According to analysts, the cost to the power companies of implementing these rules would be about **$15 billion**. That sounds like a lot, but when you actually do the math, i**t would increase the average consumer's household electricity bill by only about one percent!** That's not a big price to pay for having a cleaner environment.
