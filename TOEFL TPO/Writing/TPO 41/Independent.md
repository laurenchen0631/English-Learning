It is a highly debated issue that teacher are belittled nowadays. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. Some reasons justifies why I think teachers relatively seem less valuable in the present than in the past, and I would explore only a few of the most important ones here.

To begin with, with the popularity of capitalism the knowledge and thinking become less and less eminent. Major public only concern about  who created or invented which commercial products and services. For example, people usually consider how they can earn a bucket and the most effective, modern way is to find a book or reference the performance of the celebrity. People frequently do not notice how those renowned people were taught and who taught them. Furthermore, there is rare stories about teachers or educators whose stories and achievement are covered by the sensational news of advertisements which are used by corporations to make the revenue max. That is to say, if a teacher is not a person who manages some fabulous business, his or her attainment are easily ignored by the general public.

Secondly, the development of technology brings a new way to realize and approach to new area and knowledge. While in the past people accepted formal education since limited ways existed at the time, in the present the internet and communication technology boost the approaches that we learn. Taking my experience in college for instance, I majored in computer science and the most part of assignment was about the programming. However, the professor usually instructed the theory of computer science and abstract level of software. The students gradually became less enthusiastic about the class and then they as well as me started to find an answer of things, such as homework or the complicated concept on the textbook, through internet. On the words, people can still learn much knowledge through the modern technology, teachers have not been the only resource that you can require wisdom.

Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that, compared to the past, significance of teachers actually degrade , which is due half to dominance of capitalism and half to emergence of the internet. Given the elements, many people, in part, belittle the value of teachers.
