It is a highly debated issue that most advertisements exaggerate the actual effect of products. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. Some reasons justifies why I think that most advertisements deceive people, and I would explore only a few of the most important ones here.

To begin with, seeming attractive is the key aspect that boost the number of sales. In other words, most of people don't buy the products that possibly have fewer features than others that claims have many characteristics. Taking cell phones as example, we usually see a few brands like Apple Inc, Google, Samsung promote their products which claims they have better operating system, more outstanding security system, and higher-quality cameras. However, they don't publicly clarify which functions they do not have comparing to the products produced by other companies. To be specific, for the sale number, they boast why their products are the best in the market by detracting other similar products. Put simply, advertisements put an illusion that makes them plausibly more brilliant for competing with other companies.

Secondly, most of state-of-art products are capable of upgrading the system which makes them better and better over a period. Sometimes, a product can begin to advertise itself before it officially sold in the market. Those products are entitled with the label such as pre-order, region-limited, and so on. For example, video game industries always show some premiere gameplay videos before the game are really finished, or rather like the demonstration in the clip. Admittedly, those companies does not tell any misinformation, but, however, what is displayed in the advertisement is not genuine either. A complicated product takes many years to be published after the stage of design and concept, which thus require some finance from potential investors to continue the project of new product. 

Taking account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that most advertisements are necessary to be deemed better than they are, which is due half to intense business competition and half to the evolutional progress of a product. These factors cause the advertisement looking better than they are.

## Review
It is a highly debated issue that most advertisements exaggerate the actual effect of products. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. Some reasons justifies why I think that most advertisements *to some extent* deceive people, and I would explore only a few of the most important ones here.

To begin with, seeming attractive is the key aspect that *boosts sales volume*. In other words, most of people don't buy the products that possibly have fewer features than others that claims have many characteristics. To survive the business competition, the best strategy for a company is to intentionally make its product marketable. Taking cell phones as example, we usually see that a few brands like Apple Inc, Google, Samsung promote their products which claims they have better operating system, more outstanding security system, and higher-quality cameras. However, they don't publicly clarify which functions they do not have comparing to the products *manufactured* by other companies. To be specific, for the sale volume, they boast why their products are the best in the market by detracting other similar products. Put simply, advertisements put an illusion that makes them plausibly more brilliant for competing with other companies.

Secondly, most of state-of-art products are capable of upgrading the *entirety* which makes them better and better over a period. Sometimes, a product can begin to advertise itself before it officially sold in the market. Those products are entitled with the label such as pre-order, region-limited, and so on. For example, video game industries always show some premiere gameplay videos before the game are really finished, or rather played as the demonstration in the clip. Admittedly, those companies does not tell any misinformation, but, however, what is displayed in the advertisement is not genuine either. A complicated product takes many years to be published after the stage of design and concept, which thus require *plentiful* finance from potential investors to continue the project of *the* new product. **

Taking account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that most advertisements are necessary to be deemed better than they are, which is due half to intense business competition and half to viable evolution of a product. These factors cause the advertisement *to seem* better than *the truth*.
