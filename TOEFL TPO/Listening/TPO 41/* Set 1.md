NARRATOR: Listen to a conversation between a student and an ecology professor.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: I have some good news for you. One of the students who was signed up for the summer term at the *field station* next year won't be attending after all. Your name's first on the waiting list, so if you still want to do it, the space is available.

MALE STUDENT: Aw, that's *terrific*!

FEMALE PROFESSOR: You were also interested in doing an *independent research project* next summer, right?

MALE STUDENT: Yeah, on *salt-marsh restoration*—but that was before, when I thought I wasn't going to get into the field station.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Well, you can still do it if you want. I looked over your application for the independent research project, and *it looks strong*: I approved it. And you'd have even more resources there at the field station, so...

MALE STUDENT:  The field station and an independent study... But *the summer term is a few weeks shorter than a regular term*...

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Wh-it's up to you. You'd have to work hard, but I think you can do very well. Professor Garfield-one of the professors over at the field station-

MALE STUDENT:  Yeah, I've heard of him.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Yes, well, Professor Garfield's been doing research on *salt marshes* for years, assessing human impact and methods of salt-marsh restoration. He's willing to oversee your project.

MALE STUDENT: Wow!That's too good an opportunity to pass up.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: I thought you'd say that. When I spoke with Dr. Garfield, he suggested you take a particular course he'll be teaching here in the *spring*...it's called *Advanced Topics in Salt-Marsh Management*. The course looks at salt-marsh ecology *in-depth*, and it also focuses on factors that stress salt-marsh systems, and how to assess and monitor the level of stress.

MALE STUDENT: And that background information will fit right into my project on salt-marsh restoration. This is so great.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Oh, one more thing. Do you know John Arnold?

MALE STUDENT: Not really, But he lives in my dorm. Why?

FEMALE PROFESSOR: John's another ecology student who'll be at the field station next summer. I approved an independent research project for him, too. Initially he had the same concern as you. But anyway, his topic will be similar to yours. He'll be researching how *bridges and culverts* that have been installed to *allow tidal waters to move underneath roads between the sea and the salt marshes*. Well, they're often too small...

MALE STUDENT: I guess that would result in not enough tidal water flowing into the marshes to maintain the *natural vegetation*, right?

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Exactly. And he'll be looking at how to determine the right size. So I was thinking he might be a good choice for a summer roommate for you.
