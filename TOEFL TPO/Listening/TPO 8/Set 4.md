NARRATOR:  Listen to a conversation between a student and a business professor.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: So, Richard … what’s up?

MALE STUDENT: Well, I know we have a test coming up on chapters . . . uh . . .

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Chapter 3 and 4 from your text book.

MALE STUDENT: Right, 3 and 4, well, I *didn't get* something you said on class Monday.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Alright? Do you remember what it was about?

MALE STUDENT: Yes, you were talking about a gym... a health club, where people can go to exercise … that kind of thing.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: OK, but the health club model is actually from chapter 5... so...

MALE STUDENT: Oh, chapter 5? Oh so it's not... OK but I guess I still want to try to understand...

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Of course, I was talking about an issue in strategic marketing. Um, the health-club model, um…I mean with a health club you might think they would have *trouble attracting customers*, right?

MALE STUDENT: Well, I know when I pass by a healthy club and I see others people working out, the exercising, I just soon walk on by.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Yeah, there’s that, plus... lots of people have exercise equipment at home, or they can play sports with their friends, right?

MALE STUDENT: Sure.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: But nowadays in spite of all that, and expensive membership fees, health club are hugely popular, so *how come?*

MALE STUDENT: I guess that is what I didn't understand.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: OK, basically they have to offer things that most people can't find anywhere else, you know quality, that means better exercise equipment, high-end stuff. Um, and... classes... exercise classes, maybe *aerobics*...

MALE STUDENT: I’m not sure if I... oh, OK,I get it.. . Yeah. And you know, another thing is, I think people probably feel good about themselves when they’re at the gym. And they can meet new people, socialize...

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Right, so health clubs offer high quality facilities, and also they sell an image about people having more fun, relating better to others and improving their own lives if they become members.

MALE STUDENT: Sure that makes sense.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Well, then, can you think of another business or organization that could benefit from doing this?

MALE STUDENT: Um.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Think about an important building on campus here, something everyone uses, a major source of information?

MALE STUDENT: You mean like, an administrative building?

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Well, that is not what I had in my mind.

MALE STUDENT: Oh! You mean the library?

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Exactly. Libraries. Imagine public libraries. They’re an information resource for the whole community, right?

MALE STUDENT: Well, they can be, but... now, with the Internet, and big bookstores, you can probably get what you need without going to a library.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: That's true. So if you were the director of a public library, what would you do about that?

MALE STUDENT: To get more people to stop in? Well, like you said, better equipment, maybe a super fast internet connection. And not just a good variety of books but also like nice and comfortable areas where people can read and do research. Things that make them want to come to the library and stay.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Great.

MALE STUDENT: Oh, and... maybe have authors come and do some readings? Or, I don’t know.. . special presentations. Something people couldn’t get at home.

FEMALE PROFESSOR: Now, you are getting it.

MALE STUDENT: Thanks, professor Wilkins. I think so too …
