NARRATOR:  Listen to a conversation between a student and a librarian.

MALE STUDENT: Hi. I’m new here… I, uh, couldn’t come to the *student orientation*—and I’m wondering if you can give me a few quick *pointers* about the library? I'd really appreciate it.

FEMALE LIBRARIAN: Sure. I'd be glad to. What's your major area of study?

MALE STUDENT: Latin American Literature.

FEMALE LIBRARIAN: OK. Well, over here's the section where we have language, literature and arts, and if you go down stairs you will find history section. Generally, the students who concentrate in Latin American literature find themselves researching in the history section a lot.

MALE STUDENT: Um-hmm, you are right. I am a transfer student and I've already done a year in another university so I know how the research can go. I spent a lot of time in history section. So how long can I borrow books for?

FEMALE LIBRARIAN: Our *loan* period is a month. Oh I should also mention that we have an inter-library loan service.If you need to get hold a book that's not in our library, there's a truck that runs between our library and a few other public and university libraries in this area. It comes around three times a week.

MALE STUDENT: Hey, that's great! At my last school, it can take really a long time to get the materials I needed. So when I had a project, I had to make a plan way in advance. This sounds much faster. Another thing I was wondering is... is there a place where I can bring my computer and *hook it up*?

FEMALE LIBRARIAN: Sure. There is a whole area here on the main floor where you can bring a laptop and plug it in for power, but *on top of that* we also have a connection for the internet at every seat.

MALE STUDENT: Nice, so I can do all the research I need to do right here in the library. I’ll have the resources, all the books and the information I need right here in one place.

FEMALE LIBRARIAN: Yup, that’s the idea! … I’m sure you’ll need *photocopiers*, too. They are down the *hallway* to your left. We have a system where you have to use a copy card so you'll need to buy a card from the front desk. You insert it into the machine and you're ready to make copies.

MALE STUDENT: How much do you guys charge?

FEMALE LIBRARIAN: Seven cents a copy.

MALE STUDENT: That’s not too bad. Thanks. Uh, where’s the collection of rare books?

FEMALE LIBRARIAN: Rare books are up on the second floor. They are in a separate room where the temperature is controlled, to preserve the old paper in them. You need to get special permission to access them, and then you have to wear *gloves* to handle them ‘cause the oils in our hands, you know, can destroy the paper, and gloves prevent that, so we have a *basket* of gloves in the room.

MALE STUDENT: OK, thanks… I suppose that’s all I need to know. You’ve been very helpful, thanks.

FEMALE LIBRARIAN: Anytime. Bye

MALE STUDENT: Bye.
