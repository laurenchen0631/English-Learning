What do you miss most about your home when you are away? Use specific details in your explanation.

## Set 1 Response
Personally, the things I miss the most about my home are my friends and the food.

To begin with, when I first went to Canada 10 years ago, I felt very lonely in the fist couple of months because I didn't know anyone. I had no one to turn to or talk to about my troubles, that was pretty hard on me in the beginning.

Secondly, I missed Chinese food a lot, such as Kung Pao Chicken, Peking Duck and Chinese dumplings. Although I could find some of those dishes in Chinese restaurant in Canada, they still tasted different from home.

## Set 5 Listening
NARRATOR: Now listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
MALE STUDENT: Hi, good morning!
Could you help me with something?
FEMALE STUDENT: Uh...maybe.
What's up?
MALE STUDENT: Well, I'm a first year student.
FEMALE STUDENT: Everything going okay?
MALE STUDENT: Actually no...um.... this is a little embarrassingâ€”
I think I left my class schedule back in my dorm.
FEMALE STUDENT: Hm.... not a good thing to do on the first day of classes.
MALE STUDENT: Yeah...so I'm not sure where my class is.
I think I remember it was supposed to be here in Smith Hall.
FEMALE STUDENT: There is a computer for student use in the student center.
You can go over there, look it up and check the room number.
But...you'd have to hurry.
MALE STUDENT: Hm ... that's not a bad idea.
I could check my schedule for the whole rest of the day at the same time.
I don't know where any of my other classes are either, but I don't wanna be late, make a bad impression with the professor on the first day.
It's actually my very first class - Introduction to Psychology.
FEMALE STUDENT: Psychology? Oh! Okay, you're definitely in the right building.
And if it's introduction to Psychology, it's gonna be a big class, in which case it probably meets in a big lecture hall.
There're only three lecture halls in the building, one on every floor.
Just check each floor till you find yours.
There is an elevator, so you should be able to move fast.
MALE STUDENT: Yeah, but I don't know what the professor looks like or anything.
How will I know whether it's my class or not?
It'd be sort of embarrassing, sticking my head into each lecture hall, asking if I was in the right place.
FEMALE STUDENT: Well... you might luck out and find it the first time.

## Set 5 Topic 
The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the man's problem. Briefly summarize the problem. Then state which solution you recommend and explain why.

## Set 5 Response
The man's problem is that he left his class schedule in the dorm and thus he doesn't know where the classes is held. There are two possible solutions. One solution is to go to to the student center and check his schedule on the computer. Another solution is to check three lecture halls *on* each floor until he find the right one. Personally, I'd choose the first solution for two reasons.

First of all, if he looks up tge schedule online, not only he can find where introduction to Psychology is, he can also get his schedule for the rest of the day.

Secondly, it'd be really embarrassing to stick his head into each lecture hall, asking if it's the right one. It'll disturb the other professor and students as well.
