Personally, I believe that children should not receive money by taking household tasks. I feel this way for 2 reason.

First off, paying money will cause children to have a habit asking money from parents. For instance, as they grow up, it is possible that they ask more and more money from parents.

Secondly, parents should teach that what is responsibility to children. For example, if parents pay money for every tasks, children will have an attitude that every should have a price. And then, if there is no money, children undoubtedly don't do requested tasks.
