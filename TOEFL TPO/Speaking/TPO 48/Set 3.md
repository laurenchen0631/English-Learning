According to the letter, a student proposes that the university should create a art museum at the university because it provide more opportunities to students to appreciate fine art work and some former students can donate the school to build it. However, the man disagree with the proposal for 2 reasons.

First off, students can only take bus and spend nearly one hour to arrive at art museum in town. If they have student id card, they can access with 2 bucks as fee and even free on Mondays. There are also famous painter's art work too.

Secondly, the university has already had a lot of projects that may need former students' donation. Since those projects are also expensive, they may not willing to spend their money on something that is not necessary.

## An Art Museum at the University?
Many universities have their own art museums, with collections of paintings and sculptures by well-known artists. I think our university should create a similar museum on our own campus. Such a museum would give our students an opportunity to learn to appreciate high-quality fine art. It would be a great way for us to see artworks that we might not have access to other wise. In order to pay for the museum, the university could write letters to alumni asking them to donate money to help build the museum. I'm sure many former students love art and would be glad to donate money to help the university build a museum here. Sincerely, Diane Mille

## Talk 
<-NARRATOR:-> Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Did you see this letter?
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Yeah. It's a nice idea, but it'll never happen.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Why do you say that?
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Well, first of all, you can get on a bus right here on campus, and in half an hour you're downtown at the county art museum.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> That's true.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> And if you show your student ID card, it only costs like two bucks to get in.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah. In fact, on Mondays, students get in for free.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Right. And you can see some of the greatest art in the world there.
For example, you know Rembrandt, the famous Dutch painter?
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Well, right now they're showing something like twenty of his paintings.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Wow.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Yeah. [changing topics]And you know,
it's true, we do have a lot of very generous alumni.
But we're already asking them for help building a new student center and a new library.
And those are both very expensive projects.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, that's right.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> So I don't think we can expect them to donate much money for anything else anytime soon. Especially for something we don't really need.
