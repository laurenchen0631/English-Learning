## Reason
Coffee shop
1. it benefit my concentration (D6, pick small shop, less customers -> x disrupt my concentration, regular grinding noise + sound of keystroke -> immerse)
2. stimulate my spirit and make me calm (flavor and smell help think even if upset , feel sleepy at home)

## Content
**In my opinion,** the coffee shop is a place that I often go to and that is important to me. **I feel this way for two reasons.**

**First,** it benefit my concentration. **For example,** on Saturday, I usually pick a small coffee shop because there are less customers to disrupt my concentration. And also, with the regular grinding noise and sound of keystroke, it help to immerse myself into my work.

**Second,** it stimulate my spirit and make me calm. **That is because** I always feel sleepy at home, hence I usually go outside, especially to a coffee shop. With the flavor and smell in there help me to think clearly even if I am upset by a lot of things to do.

**That's why** the coffee shop is a important place to me.
