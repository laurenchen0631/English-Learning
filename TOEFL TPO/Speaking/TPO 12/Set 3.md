According to the article, the university plans to expand the broadcasting range of its radio station for enhancing their revenue by attracting more business commercials. Futhermore, the woman agrees with this changes for 2 reasons.

First off, there is only a few programs in radio due to the limited range. With the passage of these proposal, more programs will appear, which provide more professional experience for students. And, this can help them to have a better job after they graduate.

Another reason is that, according to her friend Tony, the school actually did it 5 yrs ago and it worked successfully. From commercials they earned a lot of revenue which provide more finance to other programs of the college and offer more scholarships for the students.

## College Radio Station to Undergo Major Changes?
The university is considering making major changes to the college radio station. Changes would include an expansion of the station's broadcasting range, which would allow the radio's programming to reach nearby towns. One goal of the plan is to attract more students to apply to its communications program. Another goal is to provide the university with an extra source of revenue. University officials expect the enhanced radio station to significantly increase the number of listeners, which will in turn encourage businesses to place commercials on the radio.

NARRATOR: Now listen to two students discussing the article.
MALE STUDENT: What do you think of the proposal?
FEMALE STUDENT: I think it'll work.
I mean, the range of the station now is basically limited to the campus, and so it's basically just a few programs, mainly for students.
MALE STUDENT: Yeah.
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, if this proposal goes through, there will be more programs and they would give the students more professional experience as they experiment with programming for a much larger, you know, real-life audience.
And stuff like that will give them a better shot at getting a job after they graduate.
MALE STUDENT: Of course.
FEMALE STUDENT: Besides, the whole university will benefit from it.
MALE STUDENT: What do you mean?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, you know my friend Tony, right?
He told me that the radio station at his university did something like this about five years ago.
MALE STUDENT: And?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, it's a success.
They are making a lot of money out of commercials and they are using it to offer more scholarships and to help fund projects to renovate the facilities of other programs.
MALE STUDENT: That sounds really good!
