## Notes

## Content
According to the passage, the business department of the university plans to make work experience as a requirement because it benefit their students to develop leadership and it secure employment after the graduation. However, the student disagree with the new policy for 2 reasons.

First, about leadership, the ability can't be learned from a temporary job because the job that you will do doesn't have any connection with leadership. Actually, companies only ask those students to do some basic tasks like filing stuff.

Another reason is that it cannot guarantee that companies will offer the students the position since there are other universities having the same requirement. Companies definitely don't have enough job position to give all students from different universities even after the graduation.

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.
MALE STUDENT: Did you read this announcement?
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, and I disagree-I don't think it will actually help students.
MALE STUDENT: Really? Why not?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, they talked about leadership... and organizational skills...
but that's not really the kind of work you do.
Like my older brother's had the kind of jobs they're talking about...
and typically you're just there to do basic tasks like typing or filing stuff-nothing very meaningful.
MALE STUDENT: Oh, so you wouldn't actually learn anything new...
FEMALE STUDENT: Exactly.
MALE STUDENT: I guess I see what you mean-but what about the other point they make?
FEMALE STUDENT: About this helping us after we graduate? I don't agree.
MALE STUDENT: How come?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, the problem is that there are lots of other universities in our area that have the same requirement . . .
so there are lots of other students at these positions.
MALE STUDENT: Yeah, I guess I hadn't thought of that.
FEMALE STUDENT: So even if you take a position like this in a company while you're still a student, once you graduate, the competition for permanent jobs will be impossible...
I mean, there just won't be enough jobs available for all the business graduates in this city who will be looking for full-time work.
MALE STUDENT: Hmm ... I see what you're saying.

## Passage
The business studies department at State University will now require all students enrolled in its program to complete one semester of work experience in a local corporation or small business. It is felt that students will benefit from this work experience by developing leadership and organizational skills that would not normally be learned in a classroom or campus setting. Furthermore, the relationships that students establish with the company that they work for may help them to secure permanent employment with that company once they have completed the program and graduated.
