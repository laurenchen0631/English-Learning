According to the letter, a student proposes to close the campus coffeehouse because not much people use it and the lighting there is so poor that it isn't suitable for studying. However, the woman disagree with the opinion for 2 reasons.

First off, she think the student see the empty situation during the daytime. However, at night, there are such more students there because students usually have many events like classes or job and busy in the morning.

Secondly, actually the lighting has been improved recently. Every tables have a better lighting like the library. So, the students can study there because the improvement of lighting.

## Close the Coffeehouse
Like many people, I was happy when the university opened a coffeehouse. A good coffeehouse is a perfect place to meet people or to study while having a coffee. Unfortunately, our coffeehouse is usually empty, so it's not a good place to meet people. And the lighting there is very poor, so it's not a good place to study, either. A coffeehouse seemed like a great idea, but it just hasn't worked out, and the time has come for the university to close it.

Sincerely,
Marvin Bake

## Talk
<-NARRATOR:-> Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> I disagree with his idea.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Why? It doesn't sound like it's doing very much business.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> That's probably because he goes during the day.
But in the evening...
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Oh, people go...
<-FEMALE STUDENT:->A lot of people.
Students are really busy during the day with classes, jobs, and studying.
But at night the place is often pretty full.
Students get together there all the time.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Really?
<-FEMALE STUDENT:->Yeah. It's not until night time that students actually have the time to sit down and relaxâ€”you know, enjoy a hot drink and something to eat, while hanging out or reading for class.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> So you can read in there?
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah...I mean, he's right, that used to be a problem, but recently they did some renovations, and
now I think the lighting's as
good as in the library.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Really?
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, and not just at a few tables. Just about every table's got good lighting now.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Sounds like this guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Definitely not.
