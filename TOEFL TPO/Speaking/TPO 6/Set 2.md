## Reason
1. explore oneself
2. meet others

In my opinion, I believe that doing different works at different points in the life is better than focusing only one career throughout the life for two reasons.

First off, it *helps* people to explore themselves more deeply. For example, in the past I didn't know *what area* enthusiasm was *in*. Many jobs looks exciting to me, but however they are not what I expected after trying. Trying a real work is totally different story from the imagination.

Secondly, it is hard to say that what skills you will need in your own future. For instance, if you were an artist, today you are required to promote yourself. The best way nowadays is *to construct a website*. Assuming that you have the website building skill, you can design the one that perfectly meet your expectancy.
