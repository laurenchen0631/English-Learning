## Content
According to the newspaper, someone proposes to shorten the history seminars from 3 hours to 2 hours. However, the student, she, disagree with this proposal for 2 reasons.

First, she thinks that most of people can concentrate for 3 hours. Tim who proposes in the newspaper can't do that because he always attend parties every night. So, he, no doubt, always sleep in the history seminars. 

Another reason that she disagree with the proposal is that the 3rd hour in the class is getting more interesting because students start to discuss and share their ideas. 

## Vocab
- seminar /ˈsɛmɪnɑː/ (n)專題討論會, 研討會

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
FEMALE STUDENT: I totally disagree with Tim's proposal.
MALE STUDENT: Why?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well look, Tim's my friend, but he's not your typical student.
He stays up late partying every night, week nights too.
MALE STUDENT: If he parties every night, no wonder he can't pay attention.
FEMALE STUDENT: Yes, and most students aren't like that.
They come to class prepared and rested and they can concentrate.
MALE STUDENT: So, you are saying the problem is really Tim.
FEMALE STUDENT: Yes, he was in one of my classes last year and whenever I looked at him he was actually sleeping.
MALE STUDENT: I guess if he's sleeping, he can't really know what's happening, what other people in class are doing.
FEMALE STUDENT: Right, and you want to know what does happen in that last hour of seminar?
In a lot of seminars that I've been in, that's when things get interesting.
MALE STUDENT: Really?
FEMALE STUDENT: Yes, that's usually when students get really involved in their discussion and start exchanging important ideas.
And if the history department actually did what Tim suggests, well, if they did that, what would happen is you lose what might be the most worthwhile part of the seminar.

## Passage
Currently, all of the seminar classes in the history department are three hours long. I would like to propose that *history seminars* be *shortened to two hours*. I make this proposal for two reasons. First, most students just *cannot concentrate* for three hours straight. I myself have taken these three-hour seminars and found them tiring and sometimes boring. Also, when a seminar lasts that long, people stop concentrating and stop learning, so the *third hour of a three-hour seminar is a waste of everyone‘s time*. Two-hour seminars would be much more efficient.

## Topic
