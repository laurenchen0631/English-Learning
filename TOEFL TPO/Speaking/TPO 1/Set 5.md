The woman has the problem that she need to borrow some vans to drive the elementary school kids to the zoo but she waited too long to rent any van. The male offer two possible solutions: one is to borrow a van from her friends, and the other is to use public transportation. 

In my opinion, I think that going to the zoo by bus is a better choice for several reasons. 

First of all, there is actually a bus line that goes past the zoo, it will be convenient for her and the kids because they don't have to walk too far. Second, it costs less. Compared to borrowing two vans and having an additional driver that may need compensation, paying bus fee for all kids are cheaper, not to mention that she won't need to take any effort to search for vans and drivers.

## Talking
NARRATOR: Now listen to a conversation between two students.
MALE STUDENT: Hey, Mary!How's your volunteer work going?
You still involved in that after-school program with the elementary school kids?
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah! But I've got a problem.
I'm supposed to be driving a bunch of them to the zoo tomorrow.
MALE STUDENT: Yeah?
FEMALE STUDENT: ...and I was supposed to rent a van for the trip.
But I waited too long to call the rental agency to reserve one.
And now it turns out they don't have any vans available for tomorrow.
I don't know what to do!
These kids will be really disappointed if their trip gets cancelled.
MALE STUDENT: Hmm, well, doesn't one of your friends here on campus have a car?
I mean, couldn't you borrow it for the day?
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, probably, but I'd need to borrow two cars or there wouldn't be enough space for all the kids.
Uh-huh.
That's why I was going to rent the van.
And then I need to find somebody else to drive too.
I can't drive two cars by myself.
MALE STUDENT: Yeah, that's true!
Well, I'm sure you can probably find a volunteer
or if you wanted to save yourself the trouble of hunting down the second driver, well... what about public transportation?
Check the bus schedule.I...I think there's a bus line that goes right past the zoo!
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah!That's a possibility.
But...I don't know.
it might be a real, [euphemistically] challenge supervising the kids on the bus.
Sometimes they are a handful when they get excited.
It's an option, though.
