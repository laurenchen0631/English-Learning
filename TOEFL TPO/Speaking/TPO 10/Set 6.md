In the lecture, the professor talks about how the passion plant and the potato plant defend themselves from insects. 

First, about the passion plant, it has spiky leaves to prevent from insects' landing. There are so many and dense spikes that stick out of the plant, and thus insects can't find enough room to land.

When it comes to the potato plant, those kind of plants use chemicals to stop insects to eat them. Be specific, when insects start to eat the leaves of the potato plant, the plant release a chemical throughout its leaf system. After the insects digest the chemical, they feel no longer hungry and stop to eat the plant, which are caused by the chemical releasing from the potato plant.

## Talking
NARRATOR: Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
<-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-> We all know that insects like to eat plants.
But some plants have been able toâ€¦to develop ways to protect themselves from insects.
Today I'm gonna talk about some ways plants defend themselves.
Now, some plants have physical features that prevent insects from landing on them, like the passion plant for example.
Its leaves have little spiky hairs all over them.
They are like spikes, sticking out of the plant that are so numerous and dense that they prevent insects from landing on the leaves.
Basically there's just no room for the insect to land.
And since insects can't land on the leaves they can't eat them.
So the little hairs serve as a physical feature that helps protect the passion plant from insects.
All right!
But other plants protect themselves using chemical defenses, like the potato plant.
The potato plant's able to release a chemical throughout its leaf system whenever an insect attacks it, starts eating leaf.
So, say an insect starts eating a potato plant's leaf.
That will cause the plant to react by releasing a chemical throughout its leaf system.
The insect swallows this chemical as it eats.
And this chemical discourages the insect from wanting to eat any more of the plant.
How?
Well, the substance makes the insect feel full, like it's already had enough to eat.
The insect no longer feels hungry.
So it stops eating the plant.
So, by emitting this chemical, the potato plant protects itself from insects.
