According to the letter, a student proposes to remove phones from student's dormitory room because most of students have cellphone and reduced cost benefits for students. However, the woman disagree with the proposal for 2 reasons.

First off, she feel that cellphones are sometimes unreliable because of something like bad signal reception. Thus, she'd like to keep the phone in the room as a backup option.

Secondly, about the cost, the argument in the letter is not correct. In fact, the cost is paid per call. In other words, if students don't want to pay high cost, they just need to avoid using the phone in dorm room.

## Room Phones Are Unnecessary
As part of the cost of student housing, students pay to have phones in their dormitory rooms. I think this is unnecessary, and the university should remove the phones from students' rooms. Room phones are not needed since students all have mobile phones we can use to make calls instead. Removing the room phones would also have a cost benefit for students, since we would save money if we didn't have to pay the cost of phone service for the rooms.
Sincerely,
Brad Smith

## Talk
<-NARRATOR:-> Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Hey, Jimmy, did you read this?
<-MALE STUDENT:-> I did, yeah, what do you think about it?
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> I don't know, I don't think it'd be a very good idea.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Oh yeah? But it's true that a lot of us have our own phones...
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, but it's good to have both.
The service we get with our own phones isn't always reliable.
Maybe it's 'cause there are a lot of hills around here, but
my service doesn't work that well in this area. A lot of times calls get cut off or the reception isn't good-
I can't hear the person on the other line.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Yeah, I've had some friends say that too actually.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> So it's good to have a backup option, something we can use if our own phones aren't working.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> I see what you mean. But when you think of the money...
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Well, I don't buy his argument there either.
Because I don't know if you've noticed this on the housing bill we get from the university, but
right now we only pay per call.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Oh, really?
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> Yeah... so if you don't make many calls, you don't pay much...
I mean if you use it a lot, of course, you'll pay more...
but students can avoid that if they just avoid using it as much as possible.
<-MALE STUDENT:-> Oh I see... OK.
<-FEMALE STUDENT:-> So I think they should just keep it the way it is now.
