How Disney's new Star Wars lands will help keep the magic (and profits) flowing
Story by Frank Pallotta, CNN Business | May 23, 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disney Imagineer Scott Trowbridge and I are sitting next to the Millennium Falcon. The ship is scarred with blast marks and rust; by all indications it's the same ship that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. You know: a piece of junk.
	> millennium 
	> by all indications
	> parsec == A unit of distance used in astronomy, equal to about 3.26 light years
Of course, we're not in a galaxy far, far away, we're in Anaheim, California, and the behemoth near us isn't a real spaceship. But starting next week, when Disney's new Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge opens to the public, Trowbridge — the creative force behind the land — wants guests to forget about that for a while.
	> Anaheim 安那翰，是美國加利福尼亞州橘郡的第2大城市
"We want the place to feel deep, so that your relationship with it can also have that kind of depth," Trowbridge says, motioning around what Disney calls the Black Spire Outpost — a bustling trading port on the planet Batuu. Trowbridge is speaking as if everything around him is, in fact, real. He's doing this not just because Disney's parks run on the belief in Disney magic, but because all of it must feel real in order to sell this new land to millions of Star Wars fans (a finicky bunch) and Disney park-goers (even finickier).
	> We want the place to feel deep, "so that" your relationship with it can also have that kind of depth
	> spire
		>> 尖塔 |A tapering conical or pyramidal structure on the top of a building, typically a church tower.| 
		>> 螺旋 |The upper tapering part of the spiral shell of a gastropod mollusc, comprising all but the whorl containing the body.|
	> outpost
		>> 前哨 |A small military camp or position at some distance from the main army, used especially as a guard against surprise attack.| troops in some outposts have surrendered
		>> |A remote part of a country or empire.| a few scattered outposts along the west coast
	> bustling == (of a place) full of activity.
That's especially important now. This December, the Skywalker era of Star Wars will be over. Disney is now trying to prove that the franchise is much more than just the family drama of Luke, Leia and descendents like Kylo Ren. It's betting that Galaxy's Edge will help do that.
Disney calls the land the company's largest expansion at its parks ever. Its Imagineers are using innovative technology and spare-no-expense design to wrap guests into an experience. There will be a ride that allows guests to fly the Millennium Falcon, shops that allow them to build their own lightsabers, and restaurants that will serve galactic fare like fried Endorian tip-yip — or, as we like to call it, chicken.
	> wrap guests into an experience
	> fare
		>> |A range of food of a particular type.| restaurants that will serve galactic fare like fried Endorian tip-yip — or, as we like to call it, chicken
For Disney, Galaxy's Edge represents an investment in the future, but it's also a reflection of something that has been one of the company's core strengths since it was envisioned by Walt Disney himself.
	> envision 展望 == Imagine as a future possibility; visualize.
For most of its history, Disney's success as a media powerhouse has relied on what company executives and MBA professors have long referred to as "synergies" — complementary businesses that don't just thrive on their own, but also all work in service of one another. Other companies have of course adopted similar strategies and used their various subsidiaries in this way. But Disney has practically made it into an art form.
	> powerhouse == A person or thing of great energy, strength, or power.
	> synergy 協力 == The interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects.
	> subsidiary
		>> 附帶的/輔助的 |Less important than but related or supplementary to something.| a subsidiary flue of the main chimney
		>> 子公司的 |(of a company) controlled by a holding or parent company.| 
		>> |A company controlled by a holding company.| 
Take Marvel, which Disney has owned since 2009. First Marvel makes a comic book series, which creates characters and stories and develops a fanbase for them. Then Disney makes a movie out of those comics. The stars of that movie go on "Jimmy Kimmel Live," the main late night show on ABC, which Disney also owns, to talk about it. Then, having proved that Marvel characters can thrive on the screen, Disney makes Marvel TV shows and sells them to rivals like Netflix. Later it makes a new movie, and uses "Monday Night Football," the biggest show on ESPN, which Disney also owns, to unveil a trailer. Then Disney decides to start a Netflix competitor, and it uses new Marvel shows as well as those old Marvel movies (which it ensures people won't be able to see elsewhere) as a draw. All the while, it's running special cruises on its cruise line featuring characters from the Marvel movies, creating whole new theme lands dedicated to Marvel — and, of course, making new comics and toys that reference the movies.
	> cruise
		>> 巡遊 |Sail about in an area without a precise destination, especially for pleasure.| they were cruising off the California coast
		>> N |A voyage on a ship or boat taken for pleasure or as a holiday and usually calling in at several places.| a cruise down the Nile
		>> |Take a holiday on a ship or boat following a predetermined course, usually calling in at several places.| a police van cruised past us
		>> |Travel or move around a place slowly, typically in search of something.|
		>> |(of a motor vehicle or aircraft) travel smoothly at a moderate or economical speed.| we sit in a jet, cruising at some 30,000 ft
		>> |Achieve an objective with ease, especially in sport.| Millwall cruised to a 2–0 win over Leicester
		>> |(of a young child) walk while holding on to furniture or other structures, prior to learning to walk without support.| my daughter cruised at seven months and didn't walk until just after her first birthday
The theme parks are one of the most important gears in Disney's synergy machine. It's the same basic idea: create or repurpose a story people love, build a deeper connection through an attraction, sell merchandise that lets them take the experience home, maybe create a blockbuster film franchise out of one of the rides, make a ton of cash, repeat.
	> blockbuster == A thing of great power or size, in particular a film, book, or other product that is a great commercial success.
With Galaxy's Edge, Disney can move further toward realizing the full potential of the $4 billion it spent in 2012 to acquire Lucasfilm, which owns Star Wars and Indiana Jones. And it can — it hopes — future-proof Star Wars even as the Skywalkers' family drama comes to an end. If it works, that strategy will bring generations of new fans in to Star Wars, helping the company compete against Netflix and other rivals in a splintered and hypercompetitive media landscape.
	> come to an end
	> splinter
It's not just about synergies, though. For a long time, Disney's media networks division, including ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel, has been the company's biggest money maker, but it has come under pressure in recent years. Disney may one day soon need the theme parks to pick up some of the slack.
	> pick up
		>> |to increase or improve| The number of applicants will pick up during the autumn.
		>> |to answer the phone| I tried his home number but he didn't pick up.
	> slack
Of course, for that to happen, they'll also need fans to embrace a Star Wars story that doesn't include the Skywalkers.

'Everything has to feel real'

In building Galaxy's Edge, Disney reportedly spent $1 billion to fill up 14 acres inside Disneyland with state-of the-art rides, food and merchandise that can be personalized. (A second location, in Disney World, opens at the end of August.) Guests can quench their thirst with blue milk, one of Luke Skywalker's drinks of choice, and visit Oga's Cantina — the first bar in Disneyland other than the private Club 33 to serve alcohol. Custom bottles of Coca-Cola, served in the land, will look like little droids and feature labels written in Aurebesh — a fictional language used in the film franchise.
	> state-of-the-art == very modern and using the most recent ideas and methods
	> quench
"For those guests who want to play Star Wars with us, we have ways," Trowbridge said. That deeper personalization will be made possible by technology including the Play Disney Parks app, which guests can download on their smartphones, and the resort's all-in-one bracelet, MagicBand.
When guests pilot the Millennium Falcon, which they'll do on the ride Smuggler's Run, their choices will impact their experiences in the rest of Galaxy's Edge. For example, if a guest loses cargo on the ride, Trowbridge said, the bartender at Oga's Cantina might issue a warning: "I'd watch out if I were you, because I think your name's on the list of the local bounty hunter."
Smuggler's Run will also use real-time video rendering technology created by legendary visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic, a branch of Lucasfilm. That technology will react to how the guests use the ride's 200 cockpit controls.
	> cockpit 座艙/駕駛艙 == A compartment for the pilot
Think of it this way: You could have gone to Disneyland and ridden Peter Pan's Flight any number of times over the past 64 years — but you could never be Peter Pan. At Galaxy's Edge, Disney wants you to feel like Han Solo.
And that's only one of the land's most innovative rides.
Rise of the Resistance, which will open later this year, is what Trowbridge calls the "biggest attraction we've ever built." Disney hasn't revealed much about the ride, but we do know it will have multiple ride systems, full-sized AT-AT Walkers and even a John Williams score.
	> score
		>> |The number of points, goals, runs, etc. achieved in a game or by a team or an individual.|
		>> |Gain (a point, goal, run, etc.) in a competitive game.| McCartney scored a fine goal
		>> |A rating or grade, such as a mark achieved in a test.|
		>> |Decide on the score to be awarded to (a competitor)| the judge must score each dog and handler against this standard
		>> |Be worth (a number of points)| a yes answer scores ten points
		>> |The state of affairs; the facts about the present situation.| What's wrong Simon? What's the score?
		>> |A group or set of twenty or about twenty.| a score of men lost their lives in the battle
		>> scores of |A large number of something.| he sent scores of enthusiastic letters to friends
		>> 總譜 |A written representation of a musical composition showing all the vocal and instrumental parts arranged one below the other.|
		>> 配樂 |The music composed for a film or play.| a film score
		>> |Orchestrate or arrange (a piece of music), typically for a specified instrument or instruments.| the Quartet Suite was scored for flute, violin, viola da gamba, and continuo
		>> |A notch or line cut or scratched into a surface.| check the shaft for scratches and scores
		>> |Cut or scratch a notch or line on (a surface)| score the card until you cut through
		>> |Delete text by drawing a line through it.|
Disney CEO Bob Iger calls the ride "the most technologically advanced and immersive attraction that we have ever imagined."
"We're pushing the limits of imagination and innovation," he said at Disney's annual shareholder meeting in March. "We'll actually blur the lines for our guests between fantasy and reality and put them right in the middle of the rebellion and give them an active role in a fight against the First Order."
For some guests in the future, the experience will be so encompassing that they won't even leave the Star Wars galaxy to sleep. Disney is planning a full-service Star Wars-themed hotel, which will one day open near Disney World's Hollywood Studios and will have characters and storylines as well as a starship design.
	> encompass
		>> 包圍 |Surround and have or hold within.| this area of London encompasses Piccadilly to the north and St James's Park to the south
		>> 包含 |Include comprehensively.| no studies encompass all sectors of medical care
"Everything has to feel real," Trowbridge said. "We want there to be stuff for you to surprise you, to make you feel like you've actually walked into this universe of Star Wars."

From Sleeping Beauty's Castle to the Millennium Falcon

Disney could've just created a Millennium Falcon ride and lines likely would have been hours long. Instead, the company created an entire world with different locales and characters. Rather than touring familiar places like Tatooine or Cloud City, guests will find themselves in Batuu. Instead of Harrison Ford's Han Solo, they'll find an animatronic version of Hondo Ohnaka, a pirate introduced in the "Star Wars Rebels" animated series, signing park-goers up for Smuggler's Run.

"There's a risk that people will get in there and go, 'Hey, where is Luke Skywalker? Where's Darth Vader? I want to see that," said Robert Niles, editor of ThemeParkInsider.com. "If people come away disappointed because they're not just reflecting an old experience then that could create a bit of a chilling effect on trying to expand the franchise."
So why not just create a land full of characters and hot spots that fans already know and love?
Well, it's actually a smart move by Disney to expand the series beyond the family drama of the Skywalkers. Visitors build a stronger connection to the brand when they are front and center as opposed to an observer in this Star Wars universe, Niles said.
	> reflect
		>> |(of a surface or body) throw back (heat, light, or sound) without absorbing it.| when the sun's rays hit the Earth a lot of the heat is reflected back into space
		>> |show an image of.| he could see himself reflected in Keith's mirrored glasses
		>> 表現出 |Embody or represent (something) in a faithful or appropriate way.| schools should reflect cultural differences
		>> reflect on/upon |Think deeply or carefully about.| he reflected with sadness on the unhappiness of his marriage
	> as opposed to == rather than == instead of
"Now, if a Star Wars show comes on Disney+ and the characters say, 'we're going to Black Spire Outpost,' consumers may say, 'Hey, wait a minute, I've been there before," he said. "Disney wants to be directly relevant to every consumer, every day."
Disney not only wants to boost its theme park revenue, Niles said, but also the company wants Galaxy's Edge to have an effect on other ancillary parts of the company.
	> ancillary == subsidiary
		>> |Providing necessary support to the primary activities or operation of an organization, system, etc.| ancillary staff
		>> |A person whose work provides necessary support to the primary activities of an organization, system, etc.| the employment of specialist teachers and ancillaries
		>> |In addition to something else, but not as important.| paragraph 19 was merely ancillary to paragraph 16
		>> |Something which functions in a supplementary or supporting role.| undergraduate courses of three main subjects with related ancillaries
"It's all about, at its heart, Disney positioning itself as a lifestyle brand," he said. "It is part of your lifestyle so much so that you incorporate Disney in pretty much everything you do, from making Mickey Mouse waffles in the morning to watching Disney+ at night."
	> "at" its heart
	> waffle
		>> NA V |Fail to make up one's mind.| Joseph had been waffling over where to go
		>> NA |A failure to make up one's mind.| his waffle on abortion
		>> 鬆餅 |A small crisp batter cake, baked in a waffle iron and eaten hot with butter or syrup.|
This general idea is nothing new for Disney. The company's theme parks have long been one of the strongest extensions of Disney's corporate universe, showcasing its existing intellectual property and serving as a breeding ground for new storylines and characters.
	> showcase
		>> |A glass case used for displaying articles in a shop or museum.|
		>> V |Exhibit; display.| ‘the albums showcase his production skills
In some cases, the theme parks market films and other content. For example, Adventureland, one of Disneyland's original themed lands, was based on Disney's award-winning nature film series, "True-Life Adventures." Walt Disney himself named Disneyland's focal point "Sleeping Beauty's Castle" in 1955, four years before the company was due to release the animated feature "Sleeping Beauty."
	> market
		>> V |Advertise or promote (something)| the product was marketed under the name ‘aspirin’
		>> V |Offer for sale.| sheep farmers are still unable to market their lambs
		>> V |Go shopping for provisions.| then I have to go uptown and market
		>> |A regular gathering of people for the purchase and sale of provisions, livestock, and other commodities.| hey wanted to browse around the street market
		>> |An area or arena in which commercial dealings are conducted.| the UK market remained in recession’
		>> |A demand for a particular commodity or service.| there is a market for high-priced wine
	> focal point
In other cases, the complementary relationship has worked the other way, with the theme parks feeding content to Disney's vast array of other businesses. "Pirates of the Caribbean" started as a ride in 1967. More than 35 years later, it spawned a $4.5 billion film franchise that then influenced new rides around the world. Disney has also tried this model with "The Haunted Mansion" and will attempt it again next year with "Jungle Cruise," a film starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt.
	> spawn
		>> |(of a fish, frog, mollusc, crustacean, etc.) release or deposit eggs.| the fish spawn among fine-leaved plants
		>> |The eggs of fish, frogs, etc.| the fish covers its spawn with gravel
		>> |(of a character or object in a video game) appear at a certain point in the game.| then they enter the undead land where defenders will spawn to fight against them
		>> |(of a person) produce (offspring)| why had she married a man who could spawn a boy like that?
		>> |Produce or generate a large number of.| the decade spawned a bewildering variety of books on the forces
		>> 菌絲 |The mycelium of a fungus, especially a cultivated mushroom| a supplier of spawn for shiitake mushrooms
Disney's slate of upcoming films also corresponds with two of its major parks projects, Galaxy's Edge and Pandora — The World of Avatar, which opened in 2017. The company announced earlier this month that it would alternate releases of new "Star Wars" and "Avatar" films each December between 2021 and 2027.
	> slate
		>> 板岩 |A fine-grained grey, green, or bluish-purple metamorphic rock easily split into smooth, flat plates.|
		>> |Cover (something, especially a roof) with slates.| he was working for his father slating a new roof
		>> |A flat plate of slate formerly used for writing on in schools.| the teacher was demonstrating, the children copying on to slates
		>> |A bluish-grey colour.| suits of slate grey
		>> 候選人名單 |A list of candidates for election to a post or office, typically a group sharing a set of political views.|
		>> |Nominate (someone) as a candidate for an office or post.| I understand that I am being slated for promotion
		>> |A board showing the identifying details of a take in a film, held in front of the camera at the beginning and end of the take.|
		>> |Identify (a take in a film) using a slate.| the assistant cameraman is about to slate the scene
		>> NA |Schedule; plan.| London shows are slated for late June
Galaxy's Edge is also a major investment in the future of Disney's parks division at a time when that division looks more important to the future of the whole company.
Profits in Disney's media networks hit a high in 2015, but have since declined 15%, likely due to cord-cutting and rising programming costs, neither of which promise to improve soon.
	> hit a high
	> cord-cutting == the practice of cancelling or forgoing a pay television subscription or landline phone connection in favour of an alternative Internet-based or wireless service.
In that same period, profits for Disney's parks and resorts have gone up 47%.
It's no wonder, then, why Disney is investing so heavily in the parks, even beyond the Galaxy's Edge expansion. It's adding new attractions to Epcot including a "Guardians of the Galaxy" roller coaster and a ride based on "Ratatouille," building new Marvel-themed areas at Disney's California Adventure, Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland and a "Zootopia"-themed land in Shanghai's Disneyland Park.
	> roller coaster 過山車
	> Ratatouille 料理鼠王
As its theme parks become more important to its bottom line, Disney also needs to invest in them in order to keep its competitors in that space at bay. Comcast's Universal Studios shook up the theme park industry in 2010 with the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, an interactive land set in the story of Harry Potter.
	> bottom line
		>> |the most important fact in a situation| The bottom line is that we need another ten thousand dollars to complete the project.
		>> 損益表底線 |the final line in the accounts of a company or organization, stating the total profit or loss that has been made| How will the rise in interest rates affect our bottom line?
	> shake up
		>> |to upset or frighten someone by shocking or surprising them| A series of robberies has shaken up residents in this area
		>> |to make changes in the way that a company is organized so that it is more effective or successful| A new managing director was brought in to shake up the company.
"I think Wizarding World encouraged Disney to be as aggressive as they are being with Galaxy's Edge," Niles said. "Disney doesn't want anyone to say, 'Oh, Universal's the creative leader in this industry because Harry Potter was so good.'"
The Wizarding World of Harry Potter allowed guests to purchase magic wands for use in the park, drink Butterbeer, the frothy butterscotch-flavored beverage from the series, and ride the Hogwarts Express train. It was a gamechanger in the theme park industry, and Disney didn't want to be outdone, Niles said.
	> wand
		>> |A long, thin stick or rod.|
		>> |A handheld electronic device which can be passed over a barcode to read the encoded data.| he waves the computer wand over the special barcode
		>> |A device emitting a laser beam, used especially to create a pointer on a projected image or text.| you pull out a laser wand and point at the screen on the wall
	> frothy
	> outdone
"With Harry Potter it no longer became acceptable for a top-level attraction just to be a standalone ride in this kind of mildly decorated area. You had to create an experience that brought you into a world from the moment you stepped foot into it," he said. "So Disney had to create something that was not just their most immersive thing, but the most immersive thing."
Trip Miller, a Disney shareholder and managing partner at hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners, describes theme parks as the "Rock of Gibraltar" for Disney — safer and more stable than the media side of the business.
	> hedge fund 避險基金，又稱對沖基金或套利基金
	> Rock of Gibraltar 直布羅陀巨巖
"The media side is just so rapidly changing, so whether Galaxy's Edge turns out really well for them or it's just kind of a mediocre capex spend, I think there's very little risk," he said.
	> turn out
		>> |to be known or discovered finally and surprisingly| Human beings, it turns out, aren’t very good at avoiding large-scale disaster
	> mediocre == Of only average quality; not very good.
	> capex == Capital expenditure 資本支出

May the Force be with you... Always

We already know what Star Wars is capable of.
The space saga has made more than $9 billion at the global box office since 1977. Accounting for inflation, five of the top twenty highest-grossing films in North American box office history are Star Wars movies. The original "Star Wars" alone made more than $1.6 billion domestically — second only to "Gone with the Wind" in the United States after inflation.
	> saga 傳說/冒險故事 == A long story of heroic achievement, especially a medieval prose narrative in Old Norse or Old Icelandic.
	> box office
		>> 售票亭 |A place at a theatre, cinema, etc. where tickets are bought or reserved.| 
		>> 票房 |Used to refer to the commercial success of a film, play, or actor in terms of the audience size or takings that they command.|
	> inflation
		>> |The action of inflating something or the condition of being inflated.| the inflation of a balloon
		>> 通貨膨脹 |A general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.|
	> domestically
		>> |In a way that relates to the running of a home or to family relations.| I am becoming a domestically disorganized mess
		>> |In a way that relates to activities inside a particular country; nationally.| only a quarter of French locomotives were domestically produced
	> Gone with the Wind 亂世佳人
Those numbers don't include the costs to produce and market the films, but they also don't account for all the other ways Disney has already made money off the universe, like TV shows, licensing, home video sales and merchandise. When "Force Awakens" hit theaters in 2015, analysts estimated that the merchandise tied to the film could generate $5 billion in sales within a year.
Jeff Bock, a senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations, wouldn't take a guess at how much the brand is now worth to Disney, but said the company "wouldn't sell 'Star Wars' for $25 billion at this point."
Of course, because it's Disney, there are several other major Star Wars projects in the works beyond Galaxy's Edge. There are new films coming from "Game of Thrones" creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. And there's a new live-action series: "The Mandalorian," which follows a Boba Fett-esque bounty hunter. "The Mandalorian" will air on the company's upcoming streaming service, Disney+ — part of its strategy to use its huge library of beloved content, characters and worlds to draw users to Disney+ and away from competitors like Netflix.
	> air
		>> |Express (an opinion or grievance) publicly.| a meeting in which long-standing grievances were aired
		>> |Broadcast (a programme) on radio or television.| the programmes were aired on India's state TV network
		>> |Warm (washed laundry) to remove dampness.| I was airing the sheets
		>> |The invisible gaseous substance surrounding the earth, a mixture mainly of oxygen and nitrogen.| 
		>> |An impression of a quality or manner given by someone or something.| she answered with a faint air of boredom
		>> |A tune or short melodious song.| traditional Scottish airs sung in the Gaelic tongue
But the franchise is now at an inflection point. Disney would very much like Star Wars to live on past the nine movies that George Lucas envisioned and the family he created. Galaxy's Edge is a physical manifestation of that hope and its strategy, said Suzanne Scott, an assistant professor at the University of Texas' Moody College of Communication.
	> inflection point 反曲點
	> envision
	> manifestation
		>> 顯示 |An event, action, or object that clearly shows or embodies something abstract or theoretical.|
		>> 症狀 |A symptom of an ailment.|
		>> |An appearance of a ghost or spirit.| ‘some supernatural manifestations are regarded as portents of good or evil
"If Galaxy's Edge had been set on Tatooine, fans would have enjoyed scrutinizing every detail against its cinematic counterpart," she said. "In creating Black Spire Outpost, they get all the appeal and familiarity of a spaceport/border planet, plus all of the creative freedom."
That creative freedom allows Disney and Trowbridge to do more than just create a new world for Star War fans to enjoy — the land also presents a stepping off point for all kinds of new Star Wars experiences, memories, stories and, of course, profits too.
	> present a stepping off point 
"We have so many stories we want to tell," Trowbridge told me as we sat looking around Galaxy's Edge. "That's one of the great things about Star Wars. There will never be an end to the number of Star Wars stories that we can tell."
