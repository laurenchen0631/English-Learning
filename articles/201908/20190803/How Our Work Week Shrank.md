The increasing popularity of “Summer Fridays” and working from home means that offices feel more empty than ever come the last day of the work week. But there’s no rest for some.

Sarah Fogel has a full-time job, but she gets every other Friday off. She can thank the pandas for that.
	? she gets every other Friday off 她每週五都會休息
Fogel works as deputy director of media relations for the World Wildlife Fund, which for the last decade has offered its more than 400 D.C.-based employees “Panda Fridays.” For 26 weeks out of the year, staff stay at home.

“Ostensibly, it’s a day that helps the company lessen its carbon footprint because no one is in the business,” Fogel explained. “We’re reducing heat, vehicle emissions, and energy, and that goes along with our mission.”
It also goes along with Fogel, a mother, to “get kid stuff done.” She’s working this Friday, but last week she spent her time off planning activities, going grocery shopping, and taking a nap. “I did things that help me be a mom and spend more time with my family on the weekend, because I got my chores done on Fridays.”
	- time off 休假 == a period of time when you do not work because of illness or holidays, or because your employer has given you permission to do something else
	- chore /tʃɔː/ 雜務 == A routine task, especially a household one.
Fogel, who previously paid her dues as a TV producer working seven days a week, may have hit the workplace perk jackpot. But she’s hardly alone. Statistics show that more than half of American companies let their employees jumpstart their weekend.

According to a study conducted by the research organization Gartner, 55 percent of jobs offer “Summer Fridays,” that breezily titled, hazily defined phenomenon where employees are allowed to leave early or skip work altogether in the summer months.

Those who still have to monitor emails or finish up projects are also allowed flexibility to get things done, say, poolside or en route to their weekend getaway. Increasingly, staff are allowed the perk of working from home. Last year, CNBC reported that 70 percent of all the world’s employees log at least one remote day. 
	- poolside
		> 泳池邊 |The area adjoining a swimming pool.|
		> ADJ/ADV 游泳池邊(的)|Towards or beside a swimming pool.|
Anyone stuck behind a company-issued desk might scoff at the thought of the sloths staying in the comfort of their bedroom and sweatpants. Stereotypes of what working from home looks like aside, there is a chance that minor at-home indolence yields just as much productivity as the average day in an office.
	* scoff

According to Inc, a 2016 study that polled 2,000 full-time office workers showed the average employee is only “productive” for around 2 hours and 52 minutes of their standard, eight-hour workday.
The most popular methods of distraction was “reading news websites,” “checking social media,” “discussing non-work related things with coworkers,” and, somewhat bleakly, “searching for new jobs.” 
So maybe offices themselves, with their out-of-service elevators and surprise fire drills, are not a requisite environment when it comes to getting work done. In that case, why not write a report or take a call from wherever you darn well please? 
	- fire drill 消防演習
	- requisite

		> 必要之物 |A thing that is necessary for the achievement of a specified end.| she believed privacy to be a requisite for a peaceful life

The Summer Fridays phenomenon purportedly began when Mad Men-era advertising executives collectively decided that jetting off to their weekend homes a few hours earlier was more fun than doing actual work.
	* purport

Research conducted by Adobe found that the average millennial office worker spends six hours a day on email, which, of course, can be checked almost anywhere. Provided employees don’t request to hop on a call while traversing the Bermuda Triangle, remote Fridays do not seem all that destructive. 
	* hop
		> 單足跳 |(of a person) move by jumping on one foot.| he hopped along beside her
		> 齊足跳 |(of a bird or other animal) move by jumping with two or all feet at once.| a blackbird was hopping around in the sun

Last summer, a New Zealand estate planning and investment firm called Perpetual Guardian earned itself a New York Times profile after launching an “experiment” which offered employees the opportunity to work four days a week while being paid for five. 
For two months, workers clocked in 32 hours as opposed to 40. According to their own assessment, employees ended up feeling a “24 percent improvement in work-life balance.” 
However, the Sydney Morning Herald found that many managers refused to take part in the study because they had to work their normal hours just to get everything done. 
While Fogel, the WWF employee, doesn’t find her company’s program stressful, she did cop to working extra hours in the week to make up for her Panda Friday.
	- cop to 承認做了 == to admit to doing (something)
		> He agreed to cop to a misdemeanor.
“Certainly on the media team, we’re always dialed in,” Fogel said. “By no means does everyone turn the lights off on Fridays, but it’s not as expected that you go to meetings or be dialed in unless you have to.”
	- by no means 決不/一點都不 == not by all means == not at all
		> It is by no means certain that we'll finish the project by June.

Christine Turner is the president and founder of her eponymous PR company, which she leads out of Denver, Colorado. Turner employs 50 people in Denver, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and Chicago. For at least a decade, Turner has allowed them to cut out early on a Friday. 
	? lead out
	- cut out 突然熄火/停止運轉 == to stop working suddenly
		> One of the plane's engines cut out, so they had to land with only one.
“We represent a lot of hotels, destinations, outdoor adventure opportunities, and we wanted to encourage people to live what we do,” Turner said. “It began organically, because we enjoyed leaving early on Fridays and going to the mountains.” 
“I really don’t care how people use it,” Turner added. “It’s up to them. There are weekends I use it to do errands, take the kids to the mountains, or go to spin class or yoga. I don’t think everyone goes out of town every single weekend, but it’s really nice to have the extra time.” 
	- errand /ˈɛr(ə)nd/ 
		> 差事 |A short journey undertaken in order to deliver or collect something, especially on someone else's behalf.| she asked Tim to run an errand for her
		> 使命 |The purpose or object of an errand.| she knew that if she stated her errand she would not be able to see him

A four day work-week is not a possibility for everyone. When Rick Thelen, who has worked on his family-owned dairy farm in Elkhorn, Wisconsin for over 50 years, was asked about getting Fridays off, he laughed, “You're not familiar with the dairy farm, apparently.”
Thelen added: “A dairy farm works 24/7, seven days a week, holidays, no extra pay. You do your work, then you go socialize for a little bit, and then go get ready for tomorrow morning.”
While certain industries slow down in the summer, winter delivers (slightly) lighter demands. “You’re probably more free in the winter time, but not really,” Thelen offered. “You have to care more for the animals when it gets cold, more bedding is involved and water freezes, stuff like that, but there are no crops to take care of.”
The farmer’s final assessment: “If you want to do work, there is always work to do. Otherwise, you just walk away and you pay for it later in the bottom line.”
Max Peterson, a retired corn and livestock farmer from Stanton, Iowa, said that the weather can unexpectedly halt work on Fridays. “If it rained on a Friday and we weren’t able to be outside, then we could take some time off. But we would be stuck inside, probably.”
Hourly or tipped workers, who depend on the business of those celebrating an early start to their weekend, also have to clock in.
	- clock in 打卡上班 == to record the time you arrive at work on a special machine
		> What time did you clock in this morning?
“I often work Fridays and the money is usually better, but every time [I show up] I think to myself, ‘Get out of the service industry,’” Stephen Bridges, a bartender from Brooklyn, said.
If Bridges did get Friday off, he believes he’d spend it at home. “I’d probably not stay out too late on a weekend off, just because getting off work when the sun is getting up can get to you after a while,” he said.
	- day off 休假
		> Can I have a day off tomorrow?
	- get off work 下班
	- get to sb 使憂慮 == to make someone feel annoyed or upset
		> I’m under a lot of pressure at work, and sometimes it gets to me a bit.
		> Don’t let things get to you.

David Tamarkin, the digital director of Epicurious, like all Condé Nast employees, enjoys the perk of Summer Fridays. Much like the New Zealand workers, he stressed about slacking.
“My feelings of excitement were coupled with concerns about workflow,” Tamarkin wrote in an email. “How are we going to get everything done?” But, he had come to notice, “even if the quantity of stories we run dips slightly, the quality of the work goes up.” Summer Fridays were actually “useful” for productivity, he said.
The editor said he only uses around “half” of his specified days to leave early, and only Summer Fridays when he’s traveling. “I’ll use it to tack more time onto my vacation, or get a head start on the weekend trip upstate,” Tamarkin wrote. Or he’ll do a reverse half-day, coming in late after making himself a “big breakfast.” Or he’ll do both — come in late and leave early.

Lale Arikoglu, the senior lifestyle editor for Condé Nast Traveler, agrees that Summer Fridays encourage her to “get a day’s work done in half the time.” 
“I also wonder if they represent a larger problem in the workforce,” Arikoglu mused. “If the US had a healthier attitude to vacation days and employees felt empowered to take all of them, then perhaps we wouldn’t need Summer Fridays in the first place.” 
As midseason half days become more popular, Arikoglu says more people will be encouraged to take longer trips to locations more exotic than just their local beach: “That free afternoon means that you can hop on a flight to, say, California for a weekend of wine tasting, and get there in time for dinner.” 
But that doesn’t always have to be the case. As Arikoglu put it, “I recently used my Summer Friday to take a three-hour nap, and honestly, that felt like the ultimate luxury.”
