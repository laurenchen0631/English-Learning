Within hours of a police raid of Miami Beach massage parlors in 2017, Chief Daniel Oates stood before TV cameras praising his agency’s eight-month effort to crack down on prostitution and human trafficking.
	- parlor /ˈpɑːlə/
		> 客廳 |A sitting room in a private house.| they had lunch in the parlor
		> 接待室 |A room in a public building for receiving guests.| the mayor`s parlor
		> 店 |A shop or business providing specified goods or services.| an ice-cream parlor
	- human trafficking 人口販賣
Officers had detained 10 Asian women and, through interpreters, tried to determine which of them were victims and which were perpetrators. The city, he said, had shut down four brothels posing as spas.
	- perpetrator 犯罪者 == A person who carries out a harmful, illegal, or immoral act.
	- brothel 妓院 == A house where men visit prostitutes.
“Obviously, the message to these kinds of operations is that they won’t be tolerated in our town,” Oates said.
Even before the news conference started, however, the case had begun to fall apart. Some sex workers – potential witnesses against the organizers – were gone.
One of the spas would avoid being shut down altogether. The one person charged with trafficking in the case later was allowed to plead guilty to profiting from prostitution, a lesser charge.
	+ plead
		> 懇求 |Make an emotional appeal.| she pleaded with them not to gag the boy
		> 抗辯 |Present and argue for (a position), especially in court or in another public context.|
		> 辯護 |Address a court as an advocate on behalf of a party.|
		> 承認 |State formally in court whether one is guilty or not guilty of the offence with which one is charged.|
		> 訴諸 |Invoke (a reason or a point of law) as an accusation or defence.| on trial for attempted murder, she pleaded self-defence
		> 以..為理由 |Offer or present as an excuse for doing or not doing something.| ‘he pleaded family commitments as a reason for not attending
Police across the nation have touted sex spa stings for years as evidence that they are cracking down on rampant human trafficking. The publicity surrounding these operations hit a high in February in raids in South Florida that led to charges against New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who police said was caught on video paying for sex acts.
	- sting
		> 刺 |A small sharp-pointed organ at the end of the abdomen of bees, wasps, ants, and scorpions, capable of inflicting a painful or dangerous wound by injecting poison.|
		> 刺/叮 |Wound or pierce with a sting.| he was stung by a jellyfish
		> 螫 |Any of a number of minute hairs or other organs of plants, jellyfishes, etc., which inject a poisonous or irritating fluid when touched.| a nettle-like plant with no sting
		> 被叮的傷口 |A wound from a sting.| a wasp or bee sting
		> 刺痛 |A sharp tingling or burning pain or sensation.| she felt the sharp sting of tears behind her eyelids
		> 刺痛 |Feel or cause to feel a sharp tingling or burning pain or sensation.| her eyes stung as if she might cry again

		> 刺痛/傷害 |(typically of something said) hurt or upset (someone)| stung by her mockery, Frank hung his head
		> 行動 |A carefully planned operation, typically one involving deception.| five blackmailers were jailed last week after they were snared in a police sting

But a USA TODAY review of three high-profile raids – the one in Miami Beach and others in nearby Hollywood and Southwest Florida – found that law enforcement’s tough-on-trafficking rhetoric fizzled after initial headlines. Charges were dropped or pleaded down. Spas often popped up in the same or new locations. And any notion of going after higher-ups who profit from trafficking, including international crime figures bringing women from overseas, never materialized.
	- fizzle
		> 發嘶嘶聲 |Make a feeble hissing or spluttering sound.| the strobe lights fizzled and flickered
		> 嘶嘶聲 |A feeble hissing or spluttering sound.|
		> 失敗|End or fail in a weak or disappointing way.| their threatened revolt fizzled out at yesterday's meeting’
		> 失敗 |A failure.| in the end the fireworks were a fizzle
	- plead down 減輕刑責 == to have the charge reduced to a lesser one
	- higher-up 高層人物/要員 == someone with a more important position than you in an organization

“Almost every local law enforcement that does one of these cases, the quote usually is, ‘We think we’re getting the tip of the iceberg,’ ” said Brad Myles, CEO of Polaris, a nonprofit group that operates the National Human Trafficking Hotline. “What is the iceberg? Or how many icebergs are there? I don’t know if anyone has a really good handle on who the masterminds are.”
	- tip of the iceberg 冰山一角 == a small, noticeable part of a problem, the total size of which is really much greater
		> These small local protests are just the tip of the iceberg.
	- mastermind
		> 才華橫溢的人 |A person with an outstanding intellect.| an eminent musical mastermind
		> 智囊 |A person who plans and directs an ingenious and complex scheme or enterprise.| McAvoy was the mastermind of the robbery
		> 策劃 |Plan and direct (an ingenious and complex scheme or enterprise)| he was accused of masterminding a gold-smuggling racket
Polaris estimated that 9,000 illicit massage parlors operate in the USA based on reviews on Rubmaps, a Yelp for sex spas, bringing in about $2.5 billion a year.
Hints of a broader organization not touched by law enforcement stings hover beneath the surface. Through a search of thousands of Florida public records ranging from corporate filings to massage licenses, USA TODAY found connections among more than a third of the 41 spas raided in the three recent operations alone, and links from them to a larger network of potentially suspect massage parlors all over the state.
	- filing
		> 存檔，歸檔 |the activity of putting documents, electronic information, etc. into files| a filing cabinet
		> 存檔檔案/歸檔紀錄 |an official record of something| a bankruptcy filing
		> 銼屑 |small pieces of metal that are removed from a larger piece by filing|
Prosecutors defend their track record by noting that a felony trafficking charge is just one tool in their toolbox. Because of the difficulty of getting victims to cooperate, they can look to alternatives that do not require proof that a victim was coerced, such as racketeering or money laundering.
	- prosecutor
		> 檢察官 |A person, especially a public official, who institutes legal proceedings against someone.|
		> 告訴律師 |A barrister or other lawyer who conducts the case against a defendant in a criminal court.|
	- track record 成績記錄 == all the achievements or failures that someone or something has had in the past
		> The school has an impressive/strong track record of getting its students into good universities.
	- racketeering 勒索/詐騙/敲詐
	- money laundering 洗錢
“I think much bigger and broader than just that one charge,” said Katherine Fernandez Rundle, the Miami-Dade state attorney.
Fernandez Rundle ran through her list of what matters most: “What were the outcomes of the cases? Did we shut them down? Was somebody punished? Was somebody held accountable? Was a victim rescued? Were there proceeds that were taken? Were business licenses forfeited? Did people go to prison? Did people go to jail?”
Operation Spa LLC, a multi-agency, two-year law enforcement operation in Southwest Florida, convicted six operators for racketeering and/or money laundering, resulting in probable prison sentences of up to three years. Even in that case, though, eight women pleaded guilty to prostitution-related crimes.
Florida law enforcement often falls back on charging women working in the massage parlors. Of the 57 arrested in the three recent raids, all but three were women, mostly immigrants from China but also Cuba, Haiti, Guatemala and elsewhere. Forty-two faced prostitution charges.
	- Haiti 海地，是位於加勒比海的島國
	- Guatemala 瓜地馬拉，位於中美洲
After each of two summer raids in Hollywood, the department released a poster with mugshots of those charged, touting its aggressive approach. The posters were a sea of women and one man.
	- mugshot 員警為嫌疑犯拍的臉部照片 == a photograph taken by the police of a person who has been charged with a crime
	- poster
		> 海報 |A large printed picture used for decoration.|
		> 廣告/布告 |A large printed picture, notice, or advertisement displayed in a public place.| a poster campaign
		> 貼文者 |A person who publishes something online, typically on a blog or social media website or application.|
		> 張貼 |Put up posters in an area.| illegal postering in downtown Montreal’
“We will continue to crack down on these types of businesses, which are used as fronts for prostitution,” Police Chief Tomas Sanchez said in a news release. “These massage parlors breed other criminal activities, including human and sex trafficking, drug sales and money laundering.”
By the time police completed the second operation, they had charged at least 30 women with prostitution.
Though the case in which Kraft was charged continues, it’s followed the same trajectory.
In March, Martin County Sheriff Will Snyder told USA TODAY that the spas involved had “all the trappings of human trafficking.” Today, only one woman who ran a spa in Vero Beach faces charges even tangentially tied to trafficking, through a racketeering statute. 
	- tangentially
		> 幾乎沒關地 |In a way that relates only slightly to a matter; peripherally.| the narrative deals only tangentially with marriage
		> 正切地 |In the manner, position, or direction of a tangent.| the line is oriented tangentially along the epidermal cell layer
	- statute /ˈstatʃuːt/ 
		> 成文法/法規 |A written law passed by a legislative body.| the Act consolidated statutes dealing with non-fatal offences
		> 章程/規則 |A rule of an organization or institution.| the appointment will be subject to the statutes of the university
Prosecutors charged Kraft with misdemeanor solicitation – which he is fighting. The two women accused of providing sexual services to him each face a felony related to prostitution.
	- misdemeanor
		> 小錯 |A minor wrongdoing.|
		> 輕罪 |A nonindictable offense, regarded in the US (and formerly in the UK) as less serious than a felony.|
Human trafficking experts compared law enforcement's spa approach to arresting corner drug dealers instead of going after cartels.
	- cartel
		> 壟斷聯盟/企業聯合 |An association of manufacturers or suppliers with the purpose of maintaining prices at a high level and restricting competition.| he Colombian drug cartels
		> 政治聯盟 |A coalition or cooperative arrangement between political parties intended to promote a mutual interest.|
“You take the dealer off the street, and another dealer pops up," said Carmen Pino, who participated in massage parlor investigations before he retired as a federal agent with Homeland Security Investigations in Miami. "We can shut them down today, they’re just going to move somewhere else. Because you’re still not getting the big organizers.” 

Victims are supposed to be the focus, but proving they were enslaved can be difficult

America’s understanding of human trafficking evolved as lawmakers and the public began to view those caught up in forced sex work as victims, not criminals.
Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000, citing growth of the sex trade and of the criminal enterprises behind it. Victims, Congress said, were “repeatedly punished more harshly than the traffickers themselves.”
Florida followed the federal government’s lead. In 2004, Gov. Jeb Bush signed the state’s first human trafficking law. Trafficking carries heavy penalties: up to 20 years in prison at the federal level and more in some states. In Florida, convicted traffickers must register as sex offenders, and victims receive greater protections – including the possibility of getting their criminal records erased.
As states passed get-tough laws to punish traffickers, law enforcement agencies stepped up their efforts to train officers how to respond when they encounter sex workers.
	- get-tough 採取強硬手段的 == characterized by firmness and determination to act if and as necessary
Many departments bring in experts to train patrol officers and detectives to recognize telltale signs of human trafficking. Women might be licensed for massage in more than one state, so they can be moved around with ease. Flushing, New York, is a common trafficking port of entry from overseas, so that Queens neighborhood might appear on their travel documents. If they don’t have identification, someone else might be holding it to limit their ability to leave.
Police have turned to digital resources, tracking movement by traffickers on social media and scouting for locations of interest via online review boards such as Rubmaps. Miami Beach police launched their investigation after concerned citizens shared screenshots from Rubmaps with elected officials.
Task forces organized by federal and local agencies deputized health inspectors, business leaders and bus drivers to report the more subtle clues to sex slavery, such as men coming and going at all hours, regular movement of workers to and from the spas and stored bedding, suitcases and cooking supplies.
Experts said there’s been a sea change in how police and prosecutors view these cases. Focus has shifted from sex workers to traffickers reaping the proceeds – though that hasn’t been universally adopted.
	- proceeds 收益 == Money obtained from an event or activity.
Among the most prominent cases following the new model: a sting in Minnesota in 2016, which began with a tip from law enforcement in Arizona about women rotating through apartment complexes.
	- Minnesota 明尼蘇達州，美國第32個州，明尼蘇達州是美國中西部最大的一個州
	- apartment complex 公寓大樓 == a group of buildings that contain apartments and are managed by the same company.
The operation led to what Minnesota authorities called one of the largest sex trafficking rings ever dismantled by the federal government. Hundreds of Thai women were trafficked to U.S. spas and brothels, and tens of millions of dollars were laundered back to Thailand.
Several things set that investigation apart: The multi-agency effort was led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota, instead of police, and it relied on federal agents who specialized in financial and immigration crimes.
Law enforcement went after organized crime from the start, charging higher-level members of the organization instead of women working in the spas. They partnered with the Thai Community Development Center, which helped build trust with victims.
That trust, Minnesota prosecutors said, can be undermined if the women are charged with prostitution. Without the help of victims, it’s harder to meet the law’s standard of proving force, fraud or coercion.
“It’s very difficult to build a victim-centered case if you’re also prosecuting them,” said Laura Provinzino, assistant U.S. attorney in Minnesota.
Thirty-six people have been convicted or pleaded guilty to their roles in the organization. Sixteen were convicted of sex trafficking conspiracy – five identified by law enforcement as higher-ups in the organization were convicted in a jury trial after only one day of deliberations.

41 spa raids end with few convictions – and business resumes

What happened in Minnesota is the exception, not the rule.
In Florida – which ranks third after California and Texas for human trafficking reports – stings have been carried out against dozens of massage parlors. Those raids almost never led to trafficking charges.
USA TODAY reviewed the cases of nearly 500 people charged with human trafficking from 2008 to 2017 in Florida. Just 15% were convicted of trafficking; most saw their charges reduced, changed or dropped completely. Of the three people charged in spa cases, none ended up with a conviction for trafficking.
In Hollywood, police conducted undercover operations inside 24 Broward County spas during the summers of 2016 and 2017 in Operation Red Light. No one went to prison, not even two spa officials who acknowledged they tried to bribe police.
In Southwest Florida, the state Department of Law Enforcement led Operation Spa LLC, an investigation that culminated in raids of 13 spas from Naples to Tallahassee in June 2017. Even though the state’s investigative summary noted numerous signs of trafficking, no one faced that charge.
	- Naples 那不勒斯，義大利南部的第一大城市，坎帕尼亞大區以及拿坡里省的首府
	- Tallahassee 塔拉哈西，是美國佛羅里達州州府
The Miami Beach raid of four spas went further than most, leading to one of the three human trafficking charges. Police charged Mi Cha Jones with trafficking, saying women at the spa told them that Jones knew they were engaging in sex acts and that she withheld much of their earnings to pay for room and board.
As the case progressed, the state attorney offered Jones a deal: Plead guilty to profiting from prostitution. Her sentence? Probation and court costs.
Law enforcement faced challenges in the case, including deciphering business paperwork written in Mandarin, but the biggest hurdle was the two victims, both of whom were picked up in the raid and refused to cooperate with prosecutors.
	- hurdle
		> 跳欄 |One of a series of upright frames over which athletes in a race must jump.| a hurdle race
		> hurdles 跨欄賽跑 |A hurdle race.| the 100 m hurdles
		> 參加跨欄比賽 |Take part in a hurdle race.| this gelding hurdled fluently
		> 跨過 |Jump over (a hurdle or other obstacle) while running.| all 450 runners had hurdled the barriers
		> 障礙/困難 |A problem or difficulty that must be overcome.| many would like to emigrate to the United States, but face formidable hurdles
		> 障礙賽馬 |A horse race over a series of hurdles.| a handicap hurdle
		> 以柵欄圍 |Enclose or fence off with hurdles.| a maze of individual hurdled pens
Without their testimony, Fernandez Rundle said, there was no way to prove they had been forced into prostitution.
Richard Hull joined Miami Beach police on their raid in 2017, representing the citizen’s police advisory board that wanted the spas flushed from their neighborhood. One of the spas, Jade Massage, shared an alley with a private school.
	- advisory board  顧問委員會
Seeing the conditions the women “lived, ate, slept (and) worked in” altered Hull’s perspective.
“You have kids going to a Montessori school at $18,000 a year, and you have some poor girl coming here as a slave not able to leave the place of work in the same block,” Hull said. “It shouldn’t be happening in this country.”

After the raids, at least half of the 41 raided parlors were reviewed again on Rubmaps, suggesting sex acts continued to be sold. There is no way for USA TODAY to verify those reports, which are posted anonymously, and some spa managers and workers vehemently denied sex activity continues. A few of the spas were caught up in subsequent police efforts.
USA TODAY Network reporters visited all 41 spa locations this spring and found 13 that were still massage parlors. For some, documents indicate the same people are involved in managing the business. For others, it’s hard to tell.
To neighbors, as well as nearby businesses and their patrons, who’s in charge is immaterial if the spas continue as fronts for trafficking and prostitution.
Wedged between restaurants, pawn shops, laundromats and liquor stores, the raided massage parlors typically stand out only because of what can’t be seen. Windows are obscured by signs, giant photos, curtains or darkened glass. Often, doors are kept locked, requiring clients to be buzzed in. Neon “open” signs are common, as are advertisements out front for special services.
	- pawn /pɔːn/ 
		> 卒 |A chess piece of the smallest size and value, that moves one square forwards along its file if unobstructed (or two on the first move), or one square diagonally forwards when making a capture. Each player begins with eight pawns on the second rank, and can promote a pawn to become any other piece (typically a queen) if it reaches the opponent's end of the board.|
		> 棋子 |A person used by others for their own purposes.|
		> 典當 |Deposit (an object) with a pawnbroker as security for money lent.| I pawned the necklace to cover the loan

	- buzz in 允許..進入 == to allow someone to enter a door that is controlled by an electric buzzer
		> Don’t buzz in any visitors who are unknown to you.
Bonita Spa in Hollywood advertises a “Brazilian Moon Shower” in green, yellow and blue lights. It has been raided more than once, resulting in arrests in 2016 and 2017, two of which led to charges and no contest pleas. Corporate records indicate it has stayed under the same ownership. According to Rubmaps reviews posted as recently as June, offerings may still extend beyond showers.
	+ plea
		> 請求/懇求 |A request made in an urgent and emotional manner.| he made a dramatic plea for disarmament
		> 託辭/藉口 |A claim that a circumstance means that one should not be blamed for or should not be forced to do something.|
		> 抗辯 |A formal statement by or on behalf of a defendant or prisoner, stating guilt or innocence in response to a charge, offering an allegation of fact, or claiming that a point of law should apply.|
“She is pretty open with what she offers from the get go and thus I ask her to skip the massage and we got to business,” one reviewer said.
	- get-go 開始/開端 == the beginning, when someone starts to do something, or a process starts
		> The latest research shows that babies can be taught the difference between night and day from the get-go.
A worker there told USA TODAY that she didn’t speak English but would give the reporter’s business card to her manager. The manager did not reach out, and subsequent calls to the spa were not returned.
The Hollywood Police Department declined multiple interview requests and did not answer a lengthy list of detailed questions from USA TODAY. Miranda Grossman, the department’s public information manager, said she could not comment because the department is conducting follow-up investigations.
	- follow-up 後續 == a further action connected with something that happened before
		> This meeting is a follow-up to the one we had last month.
“These investigations are ongoing and are part of a larger and disturbing picture of illegal massage parlors that are a front for commercial sex and human trafficking networks,” she said.
Citing the ongoing nature of the Operation Spa case, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Office of Statewide Prosecution declined interview requests from USA TODAY. Neither answered a list of detailed questions.
In early April, a reporter stopped at the address on Pine Ridge Road where Asian Massage of Naples had been raided two summers ago by state special agents. The parlor has a new name, Naples Healthy Spa. A license posted on the wall listed the owner as Guohua Zhang.
Six days earlier, Zhang had been arrested by the Collier County sheriff after an undercover officer said Zhang accepted $200 to perform oral sex at the spa during a massage. Zhang signed a deferred prosecution agreement. If she satisfies the conditions – which include community service and AIDS/HIV testing – the state attorney will drop the prostitution charge.

A web of spa connections suggests a network built to survive police raids

Untangling the roots of sex trade networks undoubtedly taxes the resources of law enforcement. But public documents offer plenty of intriguing leads.
USA TODAY found evidence that spas are interconnected at Florida’s Division of Corporations and its Board of Massage Therapy, in records related to the businesses behind the three high-profile raids.
Massage parlors seem to be in perpetual motion, as if stuck on spin cycle. Companies are incorporated and dissolved. Names and addresses are added and removed, swapped from one company to another or discarded when the pressure is on.
	- dissolve
		> 溶解 |(with reference to a solid) become or cause to become incorporated into a liquid so as to form a solution.|
		> 消失 |Disappear.| my courage dissolved
		> 轉變 |Subside uncontrollably into (an expression of strong feelings)| she suddenly dissolved into floods of tears
		> 轉場 |An act or instance of moving gradually from one image or scene in a film to another.| the alternatives to a cut are fades or dissolves
		> 潰散 |Close down or dismiss (an assembly or official body)| the National Assembly was dissolved after a coup
		> 使終結 |Annul or end (a partnership or marriage)|
Most of the 41 spas raided were run through limited liability corporations, which provide a layer of anonymity to business owners. Compared with regular corporations, LLCs are easy to set up and Florida, like most states, allows them to include foreign nationals.
	- national
		> 全國的 |Relating to or characteristic of a nation; common to a whole nation.| this policy may have been in the national interest
		> 國家的 |Owned, controlled, or financially supported by the state.| plans for a national art library
		> 國民/國人 |A citizen of a particular country.| a German national
		> 全國報 |A national newspaper as opposed to a local one.| the inability of the local press to compete with the nationals for news
		> 全國性比賽 |A nationwide competition or tournament.| she finished 16th at the nationals that year
In documents, parlors may appear to be owned by someone working on site, sometimes listed as the LLC’s registered agent, officer or ambassador. Human trafficking experts said those individuals can start out as victims before being promoted to house managers or might be repeat customers tapped as straw owners. The raided spas had revolving doors of registered agents, officers and ambassadors.
	- ambassador /amˈbasədə/ 
		> 大使/使節 |An accredited diplomat sent by a state as its permanent representative in a foreign country.| the French ambassador to Portugal
		> 代表 |A representative or promoter of a specified activity.| he is a good ambassador for the industry
	- straw owner == a person who owns property legally or has the legal appearance of owning something but does so on behalf of another, sometimes for a fee, and typically solely to hide the identity of the effective owner.
Angelina Li of Jal Accounting filed paperwork to remove a woman from her post as one company’s registered agent less than two weeks after the woman was arrested by Hollywood police at a Jade Spa. Li subbed in another woman who had been the registered agent for the company running a different Jade Spa in Miami Beach.
	- sub
		> 潛水艇 |A submarine.|
		> 潛艇堡 |submarine sandwich|
		> 替換成員 |A substitute, especially in a sporting team.|
		> 替換 |Replace or be replaced; substitute.| he got a lot of applause when he was subbed
		> 審校 |Subedit.| his copy was mercilessly subbed and rewritten
A year later, police raided that second Jade Spa.
Chad Brink has worked on a dozen trafficking cases over his 25-year career as supervising special agent for Arizona’s Financial Crimes Task Force. He said the turnover USA TODAY observed resembles a model he’s seen, in which the spas are essentially franchises of a larger operation.
	- turnover
		> 營業額/交易額 |The amount of money taken by a business in a particular period.| a turnover approaching £4 million
		> 人員更換率 |The rate at which employees leave a workforce and are replaced.| high staff turnover left the program with too many young instructors
		> 流動率 |The rate at which goods are sold and replaced in a shop.|
		> 半圓形派 |A small pie made by folding a piece of pastry over on itself to enclose a sweet filling.| an apple turnover
		> 失球 |(in a game) a loss of possession of the ball to the opposing team.
‘the team were sitting on their lead and taking care to avoid turnovers’|
The owners “basically lease out or sublet massage parlors, trying to rotate the girls through, so they don’t get caught as often,” Brink said. “Lady A is going to be the owner for six months, then an inspection or something happens, and right after the inspection, she sells the business. Really she’s just releasing the franchise back to the original owner.”
Brink said LLCs and the certified public accountants filing their paperwork play an integral middleman role, intentionally obscuring the true owners.
Li said she works with only a handful of spa clients and does not know of any illegal activity or efforts to hide owners.
“I'm not running the business, and I'm not even in the business, so how can I?” she said. “We just have bookkeeping for whatever the client is.”
Regardless of intent, the churn complicates matters for law enforcement.
	+ churn
		> 攪乳器 |A machine for making butter by shaking milk or cream.|
		> 攪拌 |Shake (milk or cream) in a machine in order to produce butter.| the cream is ripened before it is churned
		> 翻騰 |(with reference to liquid) move or cause to move about vigorously.| her stomach was churning at the thought of the ordeal
		> 隆起 |Break up the surface of (an area of ground)| the earth had been churned up where vehicles had passed through
		> |(of a broker) encourage frequent turnover of (investments) in order to generate commission.|
On the night of the Miami Beach raid, police cordoned off Lulu Massage with yellow tape, its “OPEN” sign still lit but its doors shut.
	- cordon
		> 封鎖線 |A line or circle of police, soldiers, or guards preventing access to or from an area or building.|
		> |A fruit tree trained to grow as a single stem.|
		> 飛簷層 |A projecting course of brick or stone on the face of a wall.|
	- cordon sth off 封鎖隔離 == Prevent access to or from an area or building by surrounding it with police or other guards.
		> the city centre was cordoned off after fires were discovered in two stores
Four days earlier, Olive Spa Inc. – a company registered to another spa in Miami – had changed its address to Lulu’s location. Two days after the raid, Lulu’s original LLC was dissolved.
The switch was suspicious, said Daniel Morgalo, a Miami Beach police captain. It prevented the city from keeping the spa closed because the business officially belonged to someone new, who was not in charge when undercover evidence was gathered.
“It is frustrating for the investigators because sometimes it's like sweeping water,” Morgalo said. “No matter how hard you sweep, it still comes back.”
Youngmei Cai & Associates handled the transfer of Olive Spa to the address of Lulu’s, which had been a Jal client for years. The two accounting firms are within an hour’s drive of each other along Florida’s East Coast
The names of the firms and their representatives – Li and Joseph Leung at Jal Accounting and Yongmei Cai – appear on records for nearly a dozen of the spas targeted in the three raids USA TODAY reviewed. Registered agents and officers who appeared alongside the CPAs indirectly connect a handful more.
	- CPA == Certified Public Accountant 註冊會計師，一般是在各國相關管理機構或協會取得認證註冊，接受委託從事審計、會計諮詢、會計服務的專業人士
In total, reporters found more than 60 spas in Florida related to 100 LLCs that used the same accounting firms or registered agents, according to corporate filings. At least three-quarters of those spas have been reviewed on Rubmaps since 2017.
USA TODAY found no mention of either CPA firm in public police and court documents related to the raids.

Tendrils across the state

Offices for Jal Accounting and Youngmei Cai & Associates are an hour apart along the I-95 corridor on Florida’s East Coast.

The names of two accounting firms and their representatives appear on records for more than 100 spa-related LLCs in Florida.
Those records connect the CPAs to more than a third of the 41 raided spas, as well as 30 spas that have been reviewed on Rubmaps since 2017.
Registered agents and officers who appeared alongside the CPAs indirectly connect a handful more of the raided spas and another 16 that have been reviewed on Rubmaps since 2017.
`
Cai, 48, and Leung, 65, are licensed accountants. Li, 37, is not. Chinese-language websites include referrals to Leung’s firm; Cai says on her Facebook profile that she is from Wuhan, China, and advertises on her website that she speaks Chinese. Spas are front and center in both firms’ public portfolios, along with Asian import, investment and real estate businesses.
	- referral
		> 提及 |An act of referring someone or something for consultation, review, or further action.|
		> 轉診 |The directing of a patient to a medical specialist by a GP.|
		> 轉診病人 |A person whose case has been referred to a specialist doctor or a professional body.|
Contacted by phone, Cai, like Li, denied any knowledge of illegal activity – although she said she was aware of the police raids.
“We do our due diligence as a CPA, but we do not know any human trafficking,” Cai said. “Because I’m a CPA, I only talk numbers and financial statement.”
Leung could not be reached for comment.
In its executive summary for Operation Spa, state law enforcement officials said using limited liability companies disguised the nature of the business and concealed its proceeds. It alone among the three raids mentioned the use of LLCs.
The case listed four companies that officers said were run by Robert Jones; his wife, Xuan Lang; and her brother, Jun Lang – all of whom were arrested. Jones and Jun Lang face prison time. Xuan Lang faces 21 months of community control.

One of Jones’ spas turned up in USA TODAY’s search with a connection to Youngmei Cai – she was the registered agent on an LLC registered to the spa’s address during the investigation. That connects Operation Spa to the Miami Beach raid two months later.
Law enforcement never connected those dots.
Morgalo said his department and the agencies behind Operation Spa didn’t share information about their respective investigations. The accounting firm connections unearthed by USA TODAY, he said, “would be something that I would want to look at as an investigator.”

Worker answers the door in a red bikini

Behind the pastel facades of a dozen spas in Southwest Florida, agents found signs that women workers were brought there to live on site. The state’s investigative summary details trips back and forth from parlors to airports, plane tickets from New York, suitcases and shipments of women’s clothing, and Costco grocery receipts.

An undercover agent reported that Jun Lang, who said he ran the massage parlors but didn’t own them, detailed how the women got there: A family member brought them from New York.
Nearly two years later, Operation Spa LLC is nearly concluded, with sentences for prostitution, racketeering and money laundering – but no one faces a human trafficking charge. In April, USA TODAY reporters visited the 13 raided locations. Five remained massage parlors.
An “open” sign hung in the window of Asian Massage of Naples on Davis Boulevard in April. Yujiao Zhan said she owned the place and another location, Jade Spa in Cape Coral. Zhan said ownership of the two parlors changed “about a year ago. It is a new place.”
The corporation listed on both of their business massage licenses formed a month after the raid. That LLC’s primary operating address is the location of a third spa in Naples.
All three spas have been reviewed on Rubmaps in the past six months. One customer of Asian Massage of Naples in January used the abbreviation of a slang term for masturbation: “She asked if I would like anything extra. Asked about prices. Went back and forth one time and settled for a HJ.”

In 2017, agents made one of their arrests at Jade Spa, where they said a woman worker had negotiated to masturbate an undercover officer for $60. Today, a red neon sign illuminates its name in one storefront of a beige strip mall on a major thoroughfare and behind a preschool.

A USA TODAY network reporter was greeted there in April by an employee wearing a red bikini and a thigh-length robe. She spoke little English but said through Google Translate that no sex services are provided.
