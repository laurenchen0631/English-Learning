Liberalized sex education policies are being considered in more states, even traditionally conservative ones, as more female lawmakers take office.

In Colorado, a law passed this spring requires any sex education taught in the state's public schools to be medically accurate and, in an unusual move, carves out $1 million to pay for it.
	- carve out 用技巧獲取 == to create or obtain something that helps you by skillful activities
		> She carved out a reputation for herself as a high-powered lawyer.
California's Board of Education updated its statewide framework in May for teaching comprehensive sex education that prioritizes medical accuracy and sensitivity to diverse sexualities.
	- sensitivity
		> 敏感 |The quality or condition of being sensitive.| a total lack of common decency and sensitivity
		> 感情 |Feelings liable to be offended or hurt; sensibilities.| the only rules that matter are practical ones that respect local sensitivities
	- sexuality
		> 性能力 |Capacity for sexual feelings.| she began to understand the power of her sexuality
		> 性傾向 |A person's sexual orientation or preference.| people with proscribed sexualities
		> 性行為 |Sexual activity.| sexuality within holy matrimony was only justified as a necessary part of reproduction
And in Virginia, a measure signed into law in March requires school-based sex education to include instruction on human trafficking.
The 2019 state legislative season is producing a bumper crop of sex education bills across the U.S., with at least 79 bills introduced in the legislatures of 32 states and the District of Columbia, according to a recent report by the Guttmacher Institute, a sexual and reproductive health research and advocacy organization. Most of the bills have been aimed at expanding youth education around healthy sexuality and relationships — and reducing the reach of the abstinence-only ideology that had become part of many sex ed classes over the past four decades.
	- bumper
		> 保險槓 |A horizontal bar fixed across the front or back of a motor vehicle to reduce damage in a collision.| she started the car with a jerk and hit the bumper of the car in front
		> 緩衝器 |A shock-absorbing piston projecting from a cross-beam at the end of a railway track or at the end of a railway vehicle.|
		> |bumper race|
		> 特大的/豐盛的 |Exceptionally large, fine, or successful.| a bumper crop
	+ crop
		> 作物/莊稼 |A cultivated plant that is grown on a large scale commercially, especially a cereal, fruit, or vegetable.| the main crops were oats and barley
		> 收成量 |An amount of produce harvested at one time.| a heavy crop of fruit
		> 大量 |An abundance of something, especially a person's hair.| he had a thick crop of wiry hair
		> 生出的牲畜量 |The total number of young farm animals born in a particular year on one farm.| failure to observe sound practice leads to a lamb crop at weaning of around 50–60 per cent
		> 一群 |A group or amount of related people or things appearing or occurring at one time.| the current crop of politicians
		> 馬鞭 |riding crop or hunting crop|
		> 嗉囊 |A pouch in a bird's gullet where food is stored or prepared for digestion.| the parent waxbill partially digests food in its crop
		> |An organ resembling a pouch in an insect or earthworm.| Serotonin is a biogenic amine that modulates smooth muscle contractions of the crop and gizzard of the earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris
		> 整片皮革 |The entire tanned hide of an animal.|

But it wasn’t just socially liberal states reconsidering the approach to sex education this year. Several conservative states were among those taking steps toward broader sex ed that, while not as far-reaching as California’s, represent important shifts that could lead to more comprehensive policies down the line.
	- sex ed == sex education
	- down the line 終將 == If you say that something happens al l down the line, or right down the line, you mean that it happens in every case.
		> Excellent acting all down the line captures the sound and feeling of that semi-feudal age.
		> Democrats and Republicans differed right down the line on what the proper responses were.
In Tennessee, for example, where Republicans control the Senate, House and governor’s office, lawmakers passed a bill encouraging schools to provide education on sexual violence awareness.
	- Tennessee 田納西州，位於美國南方，首府為納許維爾，是美國音樂聖地，也是美國鄉村音樂的中心
And in Utah, where Republicans hold a veto-proof majority in both chambers, the state's Republican governor signed a law allowing educators to discuss contraception in public school classrooms.
	- veto-proof == having enough potential votes to be enacted over a veto or to override vetoes consistently
	- contraception 避孕
Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas lawmakers attempted bills, too, although theirs did not pass.
Renewed interest in the issue was fueled in part by legislative flips during last November's midterm elections that brought into office more Democrats — and more women lawmakers — but also by questions about sexual assault and consent raised by the #MeToo movement.
Although women hold fewer than 30 percent of state legislative seats, they introduced five out of every seven state bills updating sex education standards that were enacted in the past year, according to a recent brief by the left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank. Women also introduced more than half of the bills to modernize sex education in this year's sessions.

“When you have different, new people, you're going to have new conversations and new ideas,” said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute.

The birds and the bees evolve

Although U.S. House and Senate versions of new sex education standards have been reintroduced this year, too, they are unlikely to pass, according to Jennifer Driver, state policy director at the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, an organization that advocates for comprehensive sex education.
Decisions on such curriculum choices in public schools are largely determined by the states. Twenty-six states do not require sex education, according to the Guttmacher Institute, and only 13 require it to be medically accurate.
	- curriculum /kəˈrɪkjʊləm/ 
	- medical
		> 醫學的 |Relating to the science or practice of medicine.| a medical centre
		> 藥物的 |Relating to medicine as distinguished from surgery, psychiatry, etc.| he was transferred for further treatment to a medical ward
		> 健康檢查 |An examination to assess a person's state of physical health or fitness.| they have medicals before they're sent overseas
Attitudes about sex ed have been politically polarized since at least the 1960s, hinging on whether premarital abstinence should be taught as the expected moral standard, or as one of several strategies to avoid unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
	- hinge
		> 鉸鏈 |A movable joint or mechanism on which a door, gate, or lid swings as it opens and closes or which connects linked objects.|
		> |A natural joint which performs a function similar to that of a man-made hinge, for example that of a bivalve shell.|
		> 樞紐 |A central or pivotal point or principle on which everything depends.| this period can be called the hinge of history
		> 給…裝鉸鏈 |Attach or join with or as if with a hinge.| the ironing board was set into the wall and hinged at the bottom
		> 靠樞紐轉動 |(of a door or part of a structure) hang and turn on a hinge.| the skull's jaw hinged down
	- hinge on 完全取決於 == Depend entirely on.
		> the future of the industry could hinge on the outcome of next month's election
	- premarital 婚前的 == Occurring or existing before marriage.
Since the introduction of abstinence-only programs in 1981, according to the SIECUS advocacy group, more than $2 billion in taxes has been spent on disseminating those programs even as they have been linked to increased or, at best, unchanged rates for unwanted pregnancies and STDs.
	- abstinence-only programs 守貞教育，是性教育的一種形式，其會教育學生不要進行發生婚姻以外的性行為，並以負面角度形容發生婚前性行為及女性進行墮胎後的後果
	- STD 性感染疾病 == Sexually transmitted diseases
But an uptick in public conversations about the danger of unhealthy relationships is changing the game. First came a spate of highly publicized episodes of dating violence, followed by several episodes of brazen sexual assault on college campuses, and then #MeToo, when powerful men were called out for sexual violence and harassment. With each wave of outrage, state legislators began passing bills mandating school-based education focused on healthy relationships — if not healthy sexuality.
	- uptick 上揚/趨勢上揚 == A small increase or slight upward trend.
		> an uptick in foreign tourism
	* spate
	- publicize /ˈpʌblɪsʌɪz/ 
		> 使廣為人知/宣傳 |Make (something) widely known.| use the magazine to publicize human rights abuses
		> 宣傳/廣告 |Give out information about (a product, person, or company) for advertising or promotional purposes.| Judy had started to publicize books and celebrities
“That has meant more energy around an issue that has long been lacking in sex education, which is consent,” said Nash.
	- consent
		> 許可 |Permission for something to happen or agreement to do something.| no change may be made without the consent of all the partners
		> 許可 |Give permission for something to happen.| he consented to a search by a detective
		> 同意 |Agree to do something.| he had consented to serve as external assessor on the panel
Conversations about teaching and learning consent led to conversations about control over one’s own body and the right to accurate, nonjudgmental information about health and sexuality. That has led back to conversations about comprehensive sex education. “It's not quite a circle, but this is the path that it's moved on,” said Nash.
When several state legislatures then shifted leftward with the 2018 elections, the wheels began turning quickly.

Changing the conversation in red states

It was two weeks after those elections when Jaime Winfree first decided Georgia needed a sex education bill.
Winfree, director of the Georgia Coalition for Advancing Sex Education, was at a reproductive rights conference when she heard a presentation from advocate Jennifer Chou, an attorney with the Northern California affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union.
Chou was detailing the 2015 passage of the California Healthy Youth Act, which requires schools to provide middle and high school students with comprehensive sex education that prioritizes medical accuracy and sensitivity to diverse values and beliefs on sexuality. She told the conference the bill was the result of 20 years of incremental change.
“I almost fell out of my chair,” Winfree recalled.
	- nearly/almost fall off one's chair 非常震驚 == to be extremely surprised
		> She nearly fell off her chair when she heard the news.
If the process took 20 years in California, it's going to take 200 years in Georgia, Winfree thought. But both states had to start somewhere. She decided Georgia's first step should be the same as California's: pass a requirement that any sex education taught in public schools be medically accurate.
It seemed like an easy sell, but it wasn't. The bill that Winfree and her colleagues helped author was sponsored by several Democratic legislators and ultimately died in committee. It was disappointing, she said, but her fight is far from over — Winfree is already plotting her pre-filing strategy for next year's version of the bill.
In Mississippi, a bill was introduced this year that would have made school sex education opt-out instead of opt-in, mandated consent education and required more frequent updates to the curriculum.
Recent high school graduate Ava Davis of Jackson helped shape the language of the bill as a member of the Mississippi Youth Council, which advocates for comprehensive sex education in the state.
“It's important for students to be heard, because education is directly affecting us,” she said.
The bill did not pass, but to Nash, it still represented progress. “Five years ago, six years ago, there were very few legislators who would say that they were for comprehensive sex ed in Mississippi,” she said. “Now, to get to a bill? There's a lot of building happening there.”
