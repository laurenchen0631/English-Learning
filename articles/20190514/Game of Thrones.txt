Game of Thrones’ Baffling Decision to Turn Daenerys Into a Crazy, Murderous Ex-Girlfriend
The penultimate episode of the HBO epic failed to service its main characters—several of whom met shocking demises.

The second to last episode of Game of Thrones succeeds in hammering home one principle that has guided the show and the books it is based on: there is no such thing as a just war. “The Bells” is a spectacle of carnage and horror visited on innocent people by the side we’ve come to know as “good,” unleashing hell in a moral vacuum as Daenerys burns King’s Landing to the ground. That’s the big picture. It’s where the episode makes thematic sense and where it’s most effective — and crucially, consistent with the show until now. 
	> The second to last episode 倒數第二集
	> hammer home == to make certain that something is understood by expressing it clearly and forcefully
	> carnage == The killing of a large number of people.
	> vacuum == A space entirely devoid of matter.
	> big picture == the entire perspective on a situation or issue
	> thematic
		>> |Having or relating to subjects or a particular subject.| the book is organized into nine thematic chapters
		>> |Relating to or denoting the theme of a sentence.| some languages use special affixes to mark thematic and non-thematic elements
		>> thematics |A body of topics for study or discussion.|
Zoom in a bit closer to the particulars of how this episode handles individual characters’ narratives, though, and it all comes undone. Cersei, Jaime, Varys, and The Hound meet their fates in ways that might subvert expectations built on years of predictions, theories, and textual analysis of the show, sure. But the shock of their arcs’ resolutions, no matter how movingly directed or acted, leaves little behind after it fades. What was it all for? Did any of it mean anything? There’s one episode left that might answer for it. But even then, it’s too late. This is the end of Game of Thrones — and it’s as ugly, abrupt, and pointless as war.  
	> subvert == Undermine the power and authority of (an established system or institution)
	> years of 
	> arc
		>> |A part of a curve, especially a part of the circumference of a circle.|
		>> |A luminous electrical discharge between two electrodes or other points.| modern welding generators are designed so that there is a high voltage for striking the arc
		>> |(in a novel, play, or film) the development or resolution of the narrative or principal theme.| his transformation provides the emotional arc of the story
	> moving == Producing strong emotion, especially sadness or sympathy.
I know, I know — pointlessness is the point. OK. But rushed plotting and writing that fails to crack characters’ interiority has kept this season from communicating that effectively. And this episode’s no exception. Why this all happens, what it says about the people involved, what it means in the context of everything we’ve seen until now — all of it is de-emphasized in the name of upending audience expectations with one gut-punch surprise after another. As a result, characters’ seasons-long stories seem to end mid-sentence. Their decisions feel at times inscrutably random. Nothing means anything anymore. It’s too nihilistic, even for the most nihilistic show on TV.
	> upend == Set or turn (something) on its end or upside down.
	> inscrutable == Impossible to understand or interpret.
	> nihilistic == Rejecting all religious and moral principles in the belief that life is meaningles
Adding insult to injury is the nonsensical way Daenerys’ sanity break unfolds onscreen. The Mother of Dragons becoming a “Mad Queen” may work on paper with what the show has foreshadowed for seasons — all this talk of Targaryens’ hereditary madness, and her own streak of cruelty with her enemies — but her split-second decision to systematically murder half a city of innocent people does not.
	> insult
		>> |Speak to or treat with disrespect or scornful abuse.|
		>> |A disrespectful or scornfully abusive remark or act.|
	> add insult to injury == Act in a way that makes a bad situation worse.
	> Adding insult to injury is the nonsensical way Daenerys’ sanity break unfolds onscreen
		== the nonsensical way (that) Daenerys’ sanity break unfolds onscreen is adding insult to injury.
	> nonsensical
		>> |Having no meaning; making no sense.| he dismissed the claim as nonsensical
		>> |Ridiculously impractical or ill-advised.| a tax that everyone recognizes was nonsensical
	> sanity == The ability to think and behave in a normal and rational manner; sound mental health.
	> streak
		>> |A long, thin line or mark of a different substance or colour from its surroundings.|
		>> |An element of a specified kind in someone's character.| Lucy had a ruthless streak
		>> |A continuous period of specified success or luck.| the theatre is on a winning streak
		>> |Cover (a surface) with streaks.| tears streaking her face, Cynthia looked up
		>> |Move very fast in a specified direction.| the cat streaked across the street
This is the girl who locked up her own “children” for a year because one of them killed a goat herder’s daughter. She has struggled to balance her conqueror’s instinct with the patience it takes to rule, and can be narcissistic, even myopic in her insistence on her own birthright. But she has never purposely hurt people who were not political enemies or soldiers. She vowed not to be “queen of the ashes.” So why does she pull a full reversal here?
	> narcissism == Excessive interest in or admiration of oneself and one's physical appearance.
	> birthright == A particular right of possession or privilege a person has from birth, especially as an eldest son.
The way the episode is scripted, it’s being jilted by Jon Snow, of all things, that pushes her over the edge. (Not his “betrayal” in telling Sansa about his lineage; Dany tries to kiss him again even after that.) It’s Jon pulling away from the idea of making out with his aunt that hardens her beyond reach: “All right then. Let it be fear,” she decides, forgoing hope for love.
	> jilt == Suddenly reject or abandon (a lover)
	> lineage == Direct descent from an ancestor; ancestry or pedigree.
In the 11th hour, Game of Thrones turned Dany not just into a Mad Queen, but into a crazy ex-girlfriend — the laziest of sexist tropes. And one that could have been so easily avoided. There were all the reasons in the world for Dany to snap, from genetics to bad fortune to isolation and betrayals. For the love of God, why make the final straw about Jon Snow? 
	> Dany == Daenerys
	> sexist 性別主義者 == A person with sexist views.
	> trope
		>> |A figurative or metaphorical use of a word or expression.|
		>> |A significant or recurrent theme; a motif.| he uses the Eucharist as a pictorial trope
Listen, no one who watches this show should expect to feel “satisfied” with its ending. Few characters have ever enjoyed the luxury of a satisfying conclusion. But when Robb, Catelyn, and Ned Stark died in the middle of their stories, the show was telling us something important — that being a hero isn’t enough to save you in this world. When Joffrey choked at his own wedding, the show told us that being the most powerful villain in the world isn’t enough to save anyone either. What is the show telling us now about Daenerys? About Jaime? Varys? Does it matter? 
	> choke
		>> |have severe difficulty in breathing because of a constricted or obstructed throat or a lack of air.| Willie choked on a mouthful of tea
		>> |Fill (a space) so as to make movement difficult or impossible.| the roads were choked with traffic
		>> |Make (someone) speechless with a strong feeling or emotion.| he was choked with fury
		>> N |A valve in the carburettor of a petrol engine that is used to reduce the amount of air in the fuel mixture when the engine is started.|
		>> N |An act or the sound of a person or animal having difficulty in breathing.|
	> villain == (in a film, novel, or play) a character whose evil actions or motives are important to the plot.
It’s hard to tell when the episode barely pauses to consider it.

Aegon the Conqueror vs. Aegon the Schmuck
	> schmuck == A foolish or contemptible person.

Again, by all means, on paper it’s fitting that Dany retakes King’s Landing the way that her ancestor Aegon Targaryen seized power: through conquest, not birthright. And the show has always dedicated considerable screen time to subverting the notion that anyone in this world is a hero, no matter how much they (or we) believe they are. But in the path from Dany’s well-known ruthlessness to an act of purposeless bloodshed on a scale that far surpasses anything we’ve seen from her before, a narrative step or two seems missing.
	> by all means
		>> |yes, certainly| "Could I have a glass of water, please?" "By all means – I'll get it for you."
		>> |used to give permission| "May I borrow this book?" "By all means."
There is no in-universe logic to Dany’s decision; the city has surrendered, the bells are ringing, and she’s already won. Emilia Clarke’s spectacular effort at adding depth to the moment she hears the bells — she careens between heartbreak and fury, her face a whirlpool of conflicting emotions — still isn’t enough to communicate a clear reason for what comes next. (She doesn’t even fly directly for Cersei or the Red Keep! She just windmills around, deliberately aiming Drogon’s fire at civilians.) 
	> careen
		>> |Turn (a ship) on its side for cleaning, caulking, or repair.|
		>> NA |Move swiftly and in an uncontrolled way in a specified direction.| an electric golf cart careened around the corner
	> windmill
		>> |A building with sails or vanes that turn in the wind and generate power to grind grain into flour.| 
		>> |move or be moved around in a circle in a manner suggestive of the rotating sails or vanes of a windmill.|
The problem is not that Dany goes “mad” — the show always hinted she might — it’s that we fast-forward past her motivation to commit an act of evil after she’s already won.
We know she’s lost two of her dragons and her most loyal friends and advisors; she’s realized she’ll never be loved as much as Jon as a ruler, and she’s fresh off a breakup. Why does this translate into mass murder, and not every tragedy she’s experienced before? If she’s always had violent instincts, why do they manifest this way now, with victory in hand? We never get inside Dany’s head and for a moment like this to work, we needed to. 
	> breakup ==  The end of a relationship.
	> manifest
		>> |Display or show (a quality or feeling) by one's acts or appearance; demonstrate.| Ray manifested signs of severe depression’
		>> |Clear or obvious to the eye or mind.| the system's manifest failings
Even the notion that there are no heroes in this world is continually undercut (or at least, rendered inconsistent) by Jon Snow, perpetual golden boy. Every supposed hero in this episode reveals shades of ugliness or cynicism—think Grey Worm spearing a King’s Landing guard after his surrender, or Arya’s readiness to give her life for revenge until The Hound sets her on a different path. Every one except Jon/Aegon, the character who most fits the fantasy genre’s “chosen one” trope which Game of Thrones has yet to convincingly ~sUbVeRT~ or whatever. 
	> undercut
		>> |Offer goods or services at a lower price than (a competitor)| these industries have been undercut by more efficient foreign producers
		>> |Cut or wear away the part below or under (something, especially a cliff).| 
		>> |Weaken; undermine.| the chairman denied his authority was being undercut
	> perpetual
		>> |Never ending or changing.| deep caves in perpetual darkness
		>> |Occurring repeatedly; so frequent as to seem endless and uninterrupted.| their perpetual money worries
		>> |(of a plant) blooming or fruiting several times in one season.| he grows perpetual carnations
From a viewer’s standpoint, his gullibility, strategic missteps, and failure to foresee obvious problems are all fatal flaws — but not, it seems, to anyone in the show. (Until his dying breath, Varys is “quite certain” about Jon’s viability as the right ruler for the Iron Throne.) The series finale will pit Jon against Daenerys; this episode marks one as clearly “good” and the other not. How does that square with everything else the series tells us about heroes and villains?
Jon’s rigid, honor-bound code does beautifully heighten one of the episode’s best scenes, though, in which every sound but Jon’s breath turns faint, he surveys the chaos around him, and realizes that right now, they are the villains. King’s Landing soldiers are ushering families to safety. Northmen and Dothraki, meanwhile, resort to raping and pillaging. It’s a grotesque moment in an episode full of squeamish ones, and I loved seeing that horror dawn on him. 
	> usher
		>> |Show or guide (someone) somewhere.| a waiter ushered me to a table
		>> ushered in |Cause or mark the start of something new.| the railroads ushered in an era of cheap mass travel
		>> |A person who shows people to their seats, especially in a theater or at a wedding.|
	> pillage == Rob a (place) using violence, especially in wartime.
	> squeamish == (of a person) easily made to feel sick, faint, or disgusted, especially by unpleasant images, such as the sight of blood.

‘Nothing Else Matters. Only Us.’

After Jaime broke Brienne’s heart and left Winterfell to be with Cersei again, there were people who hoped it wasn’t what it looked like — that he was riding south to kill his twin sister, not to betray the redeemed hero he’d become. So much for that. 
The scene he shares with Tyrion just before his little brother frees him — and hatches a crackpot plan for Jaime and Cersei to sail away together — is a thing of exquisite beauty and tragedy. His next scene partner, Euron Greyjoy, provokes a less poignant response. The pirate king insists on a death match against Jaime, wasting precious minutes on a momentum-stalling squabble no one asked for while two hundred more pressing things are happening. 
	> crackpot
		>> |Eccentric; impractical.| his head's full of crackpot ideas
		>> |An eccentric or foolish person.|
	> exquisite	== Extremely beautiful and, typically, delicate.
	> squabble == A noisy quarrel about something petty or trivial.
The worst character the show ever mustered has always been more plot device than human, and remains comically one-dimensional until the end. He handled Scorpions with pinpoint-accurate, Rhaegal-slaying ease just an episode ago; now he’s got the aim of a Stormtrooper. His final moments with Jaime are centered entirely around a flimsy love triangle with Cersei. And no, he doesn’t seem to have realized Cersei’s child isn’t his — never mind how Tyrion knew about it. As Euron draws his dying breath, insisting he won the fight, it even looks for a moment as if he’s staring straight into the camera. I half-expected him to wink.
	> muster
		>> |Assemble (troops), especially for inspection or in preparation for battle.| 
		>> |Collect or assemble (a number or amount)| 
		>>> |A formal gathering of troops, especially for inspection, display, or exercise.|
Anyway, as the Mad King’s daughter destroys the city he once saved, Jaime sprints to find Cersei alone and frightened under the Red Keep. Qyburn is dead. The Mountain is locked in combat against The Hound. It’s just the two of them: the queen and her valonqar, who dies the way he told Bronn he’d always wanted to in Season 5: “In the arms of the woman I love.” The crumbling Red Keep crushes them as Cersei sobs over the life of their unborn child. (She really was pregnant then—the one glass of wine she sipped after sex with Euron was a misdirect.) “The Rains of Castamere” plays over the couple’s final moments, with Jaime’s hands wrapped lovingly around her — not to “choke the life” from her, like the books’ version of Maggy the Witch’s prophecy foretold, but in affection. 
Jaime has always been toxically bound to Cersei in ways that run too deep to really reverse. But this resolution, like Daenerys’, suffers from the breakneck pace at which it zips from one plot point to the next, never stopping to let characters process their changes of heart. People are often irrational and feelings like love or anger can motivate us to do self-destructive things. Jaime is far from an exception. But I wish we’d gotten a better glimpse of the thinking that brought him here, so far from where he stood only two episodes ago.
	> breakneck == Dangerously or extremely fast.
Jaime earned his reputation as the “Kingslayer” while protecting the people of King’s Landing from being burnt alive. He embraced a life of being painted as the villain to save those people. In this episode though, we hear him say he “never cared for” those same people, “innocent or otherwise.” Fine, he changed his mind. But why did that happen? Why is this now what he feels he deserves? What extinguished the hope he once had for a different sort of life? All of it goes left unsaid.
	> burn -> burnt -> burnt
The twins’ farewell scene is beautifully acted, scored, and perfectly sympathetic toward two villains who were more compelling than most heroes. It’s hopelessly romantic, fitting for the characters, and resonant the way it’s meant to be. Like with so many character wrap-ups this season, it’s only the moments leading up to it (I repeat: Euron?!) that let it down.
	> compelling == Evoking interest, attention, or admiration in a powerfully irresistible way.

Cleganebowl, No Hype

A through line of this episode is how vengeance has the capacity to destroy a person from the inside out — it corrupts Grey Worm and Daenerys, and it might have consumed Arya too, if The Hound hadn’t stopped her from going after the No. 1 name on her kill list: Cersei. Instead, she redirects her efforts to helping innocent people evade Daenerys’s attacks. It’s through her eyes that we get a ground-level view of the carnage on the ground — the most nightmarish sequence in the episode and one of its most powerful. 
	> nightmarish == Of the nature of a nightmare; very frightening or unpleasant.
It’s a vicious, enthralling way of illustrating the anti-war sentiment George R.R. Martin (himself a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War) wrote into his books, emphasizing that the ones who suffer most in war are the powerless. “Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they’ve been gutted by an axe,” he wrote in A Feast for Crows. “They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shots that they are his now. They take the wound, and when that’s still half-healed they take another.”
	> vicious == Deliberately cruel or violent.
	> enthralling == Capturing and holding one's attention; fascinating.
	> sentiment
		>> |A view of or attitude toward a situation or event; an opinion.| I agree with your sentiments regarding the road bridge
		>> |A feeling or emotion.| an intense sentiment of horror
		>> |Exaggerated and self-indulgent feelings of tenderness, sadness, or nostalgia.| many of the appeals rely on treacly sentiment
	> entrails == A person or animal's intestines or internal organs, especially when removed or exposed.
	> gut
		>> |Take out the intestines and other internal organs of (a fish or other animal) before cooking it.| 
		>> | Remove or destroy completely the internal parts of (a building or other structure)| the fire gutted most of the factory
		>> |The stomach or belly.| a painful stabbing feeling in his gut
		>> |Used in reference to a feeling or reaction based on an instinctive emotional response rather than considered thought.| I had a gut feeling that something was wrong
The people of King’s Landing mostly hate the Lannisters — we saw that through Joffrey’s reign, Cersei’s walk of atonement, and the words of everyday soldiers (and Ed Sheeran) who felt trapped in a never-ending war they had no stake in. The War of the Five Kings was based on a lie, and Dany’s razing of the city is equally devoid of meaning. Focusing on the faces of the ordinary people screaming in agony because of the whims of lords and queens is a harrowing, but fitting choice for this, the “last” war, and true to the spirit of Martin’s books.
	> feel -> felt -> felt
Arya’s chaotic attempts to leave King’s Landing and rescue women and children are smartly intercut with The Hound’s opposite path. Instead of choosing life, he embraces a futile death for the sake of killing his lifelong tormentor, his older brother Gregor Clegane. The brotherly showdown has been the stuff of half-joking fan theories for years, so it’s a bit jarring to see it play out in this particular moment. It also shuns the catharsis fans hoped “Cleganebowl” would offer The Hound. He gets his revenge, but it costs him the second chance at life he got after Brienne left him for dead.
	> intercut == Alternate (scenes or shots) with contrasting scenes or shots to make one composite scene in a film.
	> brotherly
		>> |Characteristic of or appropriate for a brother or brothers; fraternal.| he and I had such a brotherly bond
		>> |Showing affection and concern; affectionate.| you could feel the warmth and the brotherly kindness
	> showdown 攤牌 == A final test or confrontation intended to settle a dispute.
	> jarring
		>> |Incongruous in a striking or shocking way; clashing.| the telephone struck a jarring note in those Renaissance surroundings
		>> |Causing a physical shock, jolt, or vibration.| the truck came to a jarring halt
	> catharsis == The process of releasing, and thereby providing relief from, strong or repressed emotions.
The episode makes this reversal literal, by having Sandor plunge both of them out of the tower and into the flames. Like with Jaime, it tells us that ultimately, this is what The Hound felt he deserved and what he wanted, damn the rest. The “why” of that, frustratingly, is also left vague.
But hey, bonus points for not insulting Arya the way Jaime’s plot discards Brienne. Or the way Dany’s final mention of Missandei boils down to the shackle she once wore. (“Her only possession” when they all came to Westeros, really?) Or the way Cersei, the show’s once-greatest villain, was sidelined from her own story for two seasons in favor of an insufferable pirate and a half-baked pregnancy plot. Or the way Yara Greyjoy just…disappeared. Or the way Daenerys’ loneliness and heartbreak is seen as inevitably leading to irrational cruelty, just because.
	> sideline	
		>> |Cause (a player) to be unable to play in a team or game.| he has been sidelined for the last six weeks with a fractured wrist
		>> |Remove from the center of activity or attention; place in a less influential position.| a respected lawyer will be sidelined by alcohol abuse
		>> |An activity done in addition to one's main job, especially to earn extra income.|
	> insufferable == Too extreme to bear; intolerable.
With one episode left before the end of the series, there isn’t much hope left for a conclusion that justifies a season of mistakes this sloppy. But we’re not asking to be pleased. We’re not even asking to be satisfied — with a show this big, not everyone possibly could be. Just please, make it make sense.
