The Geography of Brain Drain in America
Across the United States, there are fewer states gaining brainpower than draining it, according to a new report from the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee.

Perhaps the biggest problem afflicting America is its widening geographic divide between the winners and losers of the knowledge economy. A raft of studies has documented the growing divergence between places based on their ability to attract, retain, and cluster highly educated and skilled workers and to develop high-tech startup companies.
	> knowledge economy 知識經濟
	> a raft of == A large amount of something
Talented and skilled Americans are the most likely to move by far. While the overall rate of mobility among Americans has declined over the past decade or so, still, between one-quarter and one-third of U.S. adults have moved within the previous five years, a higher rate of mobility than just about any other country on the globe. But behind this lies a tale of two migrations: the skilled and educated “mobile” on the one hand and the less educated “stuck” on the other.
One consequence of this is that states as different as Ohio and Hawaii have been considering initiatives to stem brain drain and hold onto their own talent. In fact, such policies date back at least to the late 1990s. Back in 1999, when I lived in Pittsburgh, economic-development officials there came up with the idea of “Border Guard Bob,” a uniformed sentinel who would patrol the region’s borders to convince talented local grads to stay—an initiative that quickly became the butt of jokes and was scuttled.

Now, a new report from the Social Capital Project of the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress takes a close look at the reality of brain drain across the 50 states. The report uses U.S. Census data from 1940 to 2017, and focuses on highly educated people in their post-college and post-graduate-school years—people between the ages of 31 and 40 who are either “movers” or “leavers,” heading off to different states, or “stayers” who continue to live in their home state. (Certain maps start at 1970. There is also  an interactive map with all of the data points.)
	> census == An official count or survey, especially of a population.
	> head off == to start a journey or leave a place

Gross Brain Drain, 2017

The map above shows the pattern for overall or gross brain drain in 2017. Gross brain drain is the simple difference between the share of leavers and share of stayers in a state (excluding people who move there). The biggest losers, as you might expect, span the Rust Belt, adjacent parts of the Great Plains, the South, and especially the Deep South, as well as Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire in New England. The winners (lightest purple) are on the East and West Coasts, but they also include Texas and Colorado, as well as (perhaps more surprisingly) Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, and Kansas.
	> share
	> the Rust Belt 鐵帶。美國地區的貶義詞，主要由美國中西部和五大湖地區組成
	> the Great Plains 北美大平原。大致位於密西西比河以西、落基山脈以東、格蘭德河以北
	> the South 美國南部。依據美國人口調查局的定義，美國南部包括了16個州
	> the Deep South 深南部，又稱為棉花州，一般情況下，是將亞拉巴馬州、喬治亞州、路易斯安娜州、密西西比州和南卡羅來納州視為深南部的範圍
	> Connecticut 康乃狄克州，是美國東北部的一州，也是新英格蘭區域中最南的一州
	> Vermont 佛蒙特州 
	> New Hampshire 新罕布夏州，位於美國東北部新英格蘭地區的一個州，南接馬薩諸塞州，西接佛蒙特州
	> New England 新英格蘭，當地華人常稱之為紐英倫，是位於美國大陸東北角。包括美國的六個州，由北至南分別為：緬因州、新罕布夏州、佛蒙特州、麻薩諸塞州、羅德島州、康乃狄克州
	> the East 美國東部簡稱美東，是指美國密西西比河以東的州份 
	> West Coasts 美洲西岸指美國西部的州。一般包括阿拉斯加，華盛頓州，奧勒岡州和加利福尼亞
	> Texas 德克薩斯州，簡稱德州，是全美國土地面積和人口的第二大州
	> Colorado 科羅拉多州
	> Utah 猶他州。首府鹽湖城。
	> Arizona 亞利桑那州。首府和最大城市是鳳凰城。
	> Wyomin 懷俄明州。包括舉世聞名的黃石國家公園和大提頓國家公園等
	> Kansas 堪薩斯。位於美國本土的正中心

Change in Gross Brain Drain, 1970–2017

The second map (above) considers the pattern over time, charting the change in gross brain drain from 1970 to 2017. The big losers (in purple) are parts of the Rust Belt and Plains and parts of New England; the winners are shaded green. States along the East Coast’s Acela corridor, such as New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, actually reduced their brain drain over this period, while many Southern and Sunbelt states saw the opposite pattern.
	> Northeast Corridor 東北走廊位於美國東北部的波士頓與華盛頓特區之間的鐵路路段。是美國最繁忙的一條鐵路路線
	> Acela Acela特快，是一條由美鐵經營、在東北走廊路線上行駛的高速鐵路列車
	> New Jersey 紐澤西州/新澤西州 
	> Massachusetts 麻薩諸塞州。正式名稱為麻薩諸塞聯邦，新英格蘭六州裡人口最密集的一州。波士頓為該州首府及最大城市
	> Sunbelt 太陽帶是指美國南部北緯37度以南的地區。北卡羅來納州 南卡羅來納州 喬治亞州 佛羅里達州 阿拉巴馬州 密西西比州 路易斯安那州 德克薩斯州 新墨西哥州 田納西州 阿肯色州 俄克拉荷馬州 亞利桑那州 加利福尼亞州

Net Brain Drain, 2017

The next map (above) shows winners and losers on a different measure of “net brain gain.” This factors in new “entrants” who come from other states, as well as those leaving or staying in a given state. The winners on this measure (in green) include states on the Boston–New York–D.C. corridor and on the West Coast, as well as Colorado and Texas in the West and Illinois and Minnesota in the Midwest. The losers include, more surprisingly, states in the Rocky Mountain region and the Southwest.
	> Boston–New York–D.C. corridor == the Northeast Corridor
	> Illinois 伊利諾州
	> Minnesota 明尼蘇達州。美國中西部最大的一個州。明尼蘇達州最重要的城市地區是由明尼亞波利斯和聖保羅組成的雙城地區
	> the Midwest 美國中西部通常指的是美國地理上中北部的州，包括俄亥俄州、印第安那州、密西根州、伊利諾州、威斯康辛州、愛荷華州、肯薩斯州、密蘇里州、明尼蘇達州、內布拉斯加州、北達科他州及南達科他州
	> the Southwest 美國西南部，主要為亞利桑那州和新墨西哥州。

Change in Net Brain Drain, 1970–2017

The fourth map (above) shows the change in net brain drain since 1970. Among the states that experienced big increases in net brain drain were some in the Midwest and Plains (Iowa and the Dakotas), and particularly a swath of the Southern Sunbelt. Better performers, or states that decreased net brain drain, included New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Washington, and Massachusetts. Ohio and Michigan did well on this measure, meaning they improved from being the states with the highest net brain drain back in 1970.
	> Iowa 愛荷華州
	> the Dakotas 達科他地區。包然北達科他州與南達科他州
	> swath == A broad strip or area of something 
	> Ohio 俄亥俄州位於美國中東部，是五大湖地區的組成部分
	> Michigan 密西根州，位於五大湖地區。

Bringing it all together, the best performers over the past three-quarters of a century are the states along the Boston–New York–D.C. corridor; on the West Coast; and Illinois, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, and Hawaii. States fared the worst, experiencing more brain drain, in parts of the Midwest, the Great Plains, New England, the Southeast, and especially the Deep South.
	> three-quarters 四分之三
	> fare
		>> |Perform in a specified way in a particular situation or over a particular period.| the party fared badly in the elections
		>> |The money paid for a journey on public transport.| we should go to Seville, but we cannot afford the air fare
		>> |A range of food of a particular type.| traditional Scottish fare
The geographic winners have only seen their advantages grow since 1970. This split geography of brain gain and brain drain poses huge implications not only for our economy, but also for American society and politics. “Brain drain has significant consequences — economic, yes, but also political and cultural,” the report notes. “By increasing social segregation, it limits opportunities for disparate groups to connect. And by siphoning a source of economic innovation from emptying communities, brain drain can also lead to crumbling institutions of civil society. As those natives who have more resources leave, those left behind may struggle to support churches, police athletic leagues, parent-teacher associations, and local businesses.”
	> pose implication
	> segregation == The action or state of setting someone or something apart from others
	> siphon == syphon

		>> |Draw off or convey (liquid) by means of a siphon.| 
The end result is a lopsided “winner-take-all” pattern of regional haves and have-nots. Our politics become ever more divisive and polarized as the “big sort” grows ever bigger, eating away at the social fabric of our nation.
