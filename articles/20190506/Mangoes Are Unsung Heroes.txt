With Venezuela In Chaos, Mangoes Are Unsung Heroes

During these troubled times in Venezuela, the mango has a new identity.
	> Venezuela 委內瑞拉
	> mango 芒果

"We call them 'the noise takers' because they calm down the noise that our stomachs make when we are hungry," says Danilson Hernández, who manages a modest business that upholsters vehicles in Maracaibo, Venezuela.
	> modest
		>> |Unassuming or moderate in the estimation of one's abilities or achievements.| he was a very modest man, refusing to take any credit for the enterprise
		>> |(of an amount, rate, or level) relatively moderate, limited, or small| drink modest amounts of alcohol
	> upholster == Provide (furniture) with a soft, padded covering.
		>> She had plush upholstered chairs set up around the table with a special throne-like chair at the head of the table.

And there are a lot of hungry people in crisis-ridden Venezuela. Nearly 90 percent of families don't earn enough money to buy the food they need, according to the latest Life Conditions National Survey, run annually by college professors.
	> crisis-ridden
	> Nearly 90 percent of families don't earn enough money to buy the food they need
		>> enough ... to ...
		>> the food (that) they need

Hernandez, who's in his late forties, eats a couple of mangoes for breakfast almost every day. He picks from the many fruits that fall to the ground from two 82-foot-tall trees that cast shadows on his workplace. They're slightly sour and a bit bitter if they're green — and sweet if they're fully ripe.
	> in his late forties 四十歲後半 == in his late 40s
	> a couple of
		>> |Two individuals of the same sort considered together| a couple of girls were playing marbles
		>> |An indefinite small number.| he hoped she'd be better in a couple of days
	> foot == feet 英呎 ==  0.3048 meter
	> a bit (ADV)
	> ripe == (of fruit or grain) developed to the point of readiness for harvesting and eating

In fact, the trees shed so many mangoes on his sandy yard, he says, that workers and housemaids from nearby stores and apartments often come by to ask him for some.
	> yard
		>> 後院 |A piece of ground adjoining a building or house.| Most people in New Zealand live in single houses with large yards and flower or vegetable gardens.
		>> 碼 |A unit of linear measure equal to 3 feet (0.9144 meter).|
		>> 院子/天井/庭院
	> housemaids == A female domestic employee
	> come by
		> |Call casually and briefly as a visitor| his friends came by
		> |Manage to acquire or obtain (something).| He had been playing the flute for some time when he realized that high quality flute repairmen were hard to come by

Some local wags are saying the abundant mangoes of Venezuela are "the real humanitarian aid."
	> wag == joker
	> humanitarian == Concerned with or seeking to promote human welfare

"The mango has gained an extra value for Venezuelans in recent years because it alleviates hunger," says Maritza de Jiménez, head of the charity Seglar Mercedary Fraternity, which distributes free lunches to some 600 Venezuelan children and 80 elderly people on weekdays. Her charity serves mangoes with the lunches. She adds that "many of our kids eat too many mangoes during the weekends, when we don't offer free lunches for them."
	> Venezuela --> Venezuelan

The mangoes may be free as well. There are so many mango trees in public spaces and private yards in Venezuelan cities with tropical weather that people can help themselves. And there's a good supply. Mango trees bear fruit for about a month at a time three times a year in Venezuela and are in season right now.
	> There are [so] many mango trees ... [that] people can help themselves.
	> there's a good supply. 供應充足
	> bear fruit
	> Mango trees bear fruit [for about a month at a time] [three times a year] in Venezuela and (Mango trees) are in season right now.
		>> in season 

The mango turns out to be a pretty good food to turn to in times of need. A cup of diced mango meets about half of the required daily allowance for vitamin C and a quarter of the RDA for vitamin A. And fiber content is high.
	> turn out
		>> |prove to be the case| the job turned out to be beyond his rather limited abilities
		>> |go somewhere in order to attend a meeting, vote, play in a game, etc.| over 75 per cent of the electorate turned out to vote
	> turn to
		>> |to go to someone for help| I’m sorry, but I had no one else to turn to.
		>> |to start to do or to use something in an attempt to help yourself| He turned to drugs after his wife left him.
	> diced == cut into small cubes.
	> fiber content 纖維含量

"Fiber increases when it gets in touch with the stomach fluids. That's why people feel satiated," says Ealys López de Márquez, head of the School of Nutrition and Dietetics in the University of Zulia, one of the largest in the country.
	> in touch with
	> the stomach fluids

But as a main course, the mango does have shortcomings. For example, there's only 1 gram of protein in a one cup serving.

Yet for many Venezuelans, there may not be an alternative. José Áñez, a 75-year-old pensioner, savors a mango outside a Catholic charity where he waits for a free plate of soup alongside dozens of elderly.
	> pension == A regular payment made by the state to people of or above the official retirement age and to some widows and disabled people.
	> savor == savour
		>> |Taste (good food or drink) and enjoy it to the full.|

"We're having a really bad time. This fruit is the favorite one for us. I can have it anytime of the day. It calms down the hunger a little bit," he says, smiling.
	> calm down == if a situation calms down, there is less activity 

Juan Manuel Rodríguez, who's in his 50s and is a father of three, says he eats between three and eight mangoes a day. He also prepares mango dishes to sale on the sidewalks of Maracaibo.
	> Maracaibo == A city and port in north-western Venezuela

His most popular offering is made with sliced mango, Worcestershire sauce, marinade, vinegar and salt. He's nicknamed it "Viagra" and boasts that it'll help boost a man's sexual performance. Most people don't really believe that but they do buy the dish because it's tasty and cheap — about the equivalent of 20 U.S. cents for a serving.
	> Worcestershire == Worcestershire
	> Worcestershire sauce 伍斯特醬
	> marinade 醃泡汁 == A mixture of oil, wine, spices, or similar ingredients, in which meat, fish, or other food is soaked before cooking in order to flavour or soften it.
	> vinegar 醋 == A sour-tasting liquid containing acetic acid, obtained by fermenting dilute alcoholic liquids, typically wine, cider, or beer, and used as a condiment or for pickling.
	> most people == most of people 

In fact, mangoes find themselves into a lot of Venezuelan dishes: salads, juices, marmalade and desserts. Mango milkshakes are popular as well but there's only a little milk in the mix, since 2.2 pounds of powdered milk costs around 60,000 bolivares. By comparison, the official minimum wage for a full-time month's work is 40,000 bolivares.
	> marmalade 果醬 == A preserve made from citrus fruit, especially bitter oranges.
	> bolivar
	> pound == 0.45359237 kilogram

Ramón Arenas Morales, a 81-year-old retired journalist, is one of the folks who gives away mangoes. The branches of his neighbor's tree hang over his porch. When the tree bears fruit, he hangs a bag filled with 20 mangoes outside his main gate every morning so people who walk by on the way to work or kids going to school can grab a couple.
	> give away 
	> porch 門廊 == A covered shelter projecting in front of the entrance of a building.
	> so people [who walk by on the way to work] or kids [going to school] can grab a couple.

"There are some desperate ones who would even ask me for the 'sick' mangoes, the ones we dump," he says, pointing up a bunch of pale-looking fruits hanging from the green branches that are likely spoiled. "I've seen desperation and hunger in people's faces. This is depressing," he adds.

During mango season, the Áñez family gives away approximately 200 mangoes every day to friends and neighbors in their neighborhood on the northeastern side of Maracaibo.
	> give away sth to someone

Mangoes are usually just a side dish, says Jesús, the father, who's in his 50s. "But we are not choosing what we eat anymore."

His wife, Ingrid, sharing a plate of five mangoes with one of her young daughters, says she finds strangers scavenging for mangoes around her yard at dawn.
	> scavenge for == Search for and collect (anything usable) from discarded waste.

In the days before the economic crisis, she says, "we used to throw hundreds of mangoes to the garbage," she says. "Now we collect them all."
	>  the economic crisis

Nerio Mendoza, who's in his 30s, is a former fisherman who stopped working because he was afraid of the pirates of the Lake of Maracaibo. Currently unemployed, he's grateful that the Áñez family shares their mangoes.

Mendoza says he walks dozens of blocks every day, scavenging among the garbage for something to sell, like electric wires, so he can buy food for Bella de los Ángeles, his 4-month-old baby girl, and Nerio Josué, his 3-year-old boy.

The man, skinny and wearing worn clothes, has a final resort in case he can't come up with meals for his family. "I'm going to look for some little mangoes where I can find them. It's tough. My kids are hungry," he says in sadness.
	> resort 
		>> |Turn to and adopt (a course of action, especially an extreme or undesirable one) so as to resolve a difficult situation.| the duke was prepared to resort to force if negotiation failed
		>> |Go often or in large numbers to.| local authorities have a duty to provide adequate sites for gypsies ‘residing in or resorting to’ their areas

But he's glad to find the mangoes. "They're very tasty," he says with a smile.
