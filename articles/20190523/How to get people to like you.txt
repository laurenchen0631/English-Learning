How to get people to like you: 7 ways from an FBI behavior expert
May 22, 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meeting new people can be awkward. What should you say? How can you make a good impression? How do you keep a conversation going?
Research shows relationships are vital to happiness and networking is the key to getting jobs and building a fulfilling career.
But what’s the best way to build rapport and create trust? Plain and simple, who can explain how to get people to like you?
	> rapport 密切友好關係 == A close and harmonious relationship in which the people or groups concerned understand each other's feelings or ideas and communicate well.
Robin Dreeke can.

Robin was head of the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Program and has studied interpersonal relations for over 27 years. He’s an expert on how to make people like you.
Robin is the author of the excellent book, It’s Not All About “Me”: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone.
I gave him a call to get some answers. (Note that Robin is not speaking for the FBI here, these are his expert insights.)

You’re going to learn:

The #1 secret to clicking with people.
1. How to put strangers at ease.
2. The thing you do that turns people off the most.
3. How to use body language like a pro.
4. Some great verbal jiu-jitsu to use on people who try to manipulate you.
5. And a lot more. Okay, let’s learn something.

1) The Most Important Thing To Do With Anyone You Meet

Robin’s #1 piece of advice: “Seek someone else’s thoughts and opinions without judging them.”
Ask questions. Listen. But don’t judge. Nobody — including you — likes to feel judged.
Here’s Robin:

The number one strategy I constantly keep in the forefront of my mind with everyone I talk to is non-judgmental validation. Seek someone else’s thoughts and opinions without judging them. People do not want to be judged in any thought or opinion that they have or in any action that they take.
It doesn’t mean you agree with someone. Validation is taking the time to understand what their needs, wants, dreams and aspirations are.
	> validation
		>> |The action of checking or proving the validity or accuracy of something.| the technique requires validation in controlled trials
		>> |The action of making or declaring something legally or officially acceptable.| new courses, subject to validation, include an MSc in Urban Forestry.
		>> |Recognition or affirmation that a person or their feelings or opinions are valid or worthwhile.| they have exaggerated needs for acceptance and validation
	> forefront

So what should you do when people start spouting crazy talk? Here’s Robin:

What I prefer to try to do is, as soon as I hear something that I don’t necessarily agree with or understand, instead of judging it my first reaction is, “Oh, that’s really fascinating. I never heard it in quite that way. Help me understand. How did you come up with that?”
	> come up
		>> |to move towards someone| A young girl came up to me and asked for money.
		>> |to be mentioned or talked about in conversation| What points came up at the meeting
		>> |appear|
		>> |If a job or opportunity comes up, it becomes available| A position has come up in the accounts department.
		>> |to happen, usually unexpectedly| I've got to go - something has just come up at home and I'm needed there.

You’re not judging, you’re showing interest. And that lets people calmly continue talking about their favorite subject: themselves.
Studies show people get more pleasure from talking about themselves than they do from food or money:

Talking about ourselves — whether in a personal conversation or through social media sites like Facebook and Twitter — triggers the same sensation of pleasure in the brain as food or money…

So you’ve stopped being Judgy Judgerson and you’re happily validating. Oh, if it were only that easy… What’s the problem here? Your ego.
	> Judgy Judgerson == Judgy McJudgerson == someone who judges everyone for their behavior, except, of course, themselves.
	> ego
		>> |A person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance.|
		>> 自我 |The part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of personal identity.| <--> id <--> superego

2) Suspend Your Ego To Get People To Like You

Most of us are just dying to point out how other people are wrong. (Comment sections on the internet are fueled by this, aren’t they?)
And it kills rapport. Want to correct someone? Want to one-up them with your clever little story? Don’t do it.
	> one-up == to get the better of; succeed in being a point, move, step, etc., ahead of (someone):
		>> They one-upped the competition

Here’s Robin:

Ego suspension is putting your own needs, wants and opinions aside. Consciously ignore your desire to be correct and to correct someone else. It’s not allowing yourself to get emotionally hijacked by a situation where you might not agree with someone’s thoughts, opinions or actions.
	> hijack
		>> 劫持 |Unlawfully seize (an aircraft, ship, or vehicle) in transit and force it to go to a different destination or use it for one's own purposes.| a man armed with grenades hijacked the jet yesterday
		>> |An incident or act of hijacking.|
		>> |Steal (goods) by seizing them in transit.| the UN convoys have been tamely allowing gunmen to hijack relief supplies
		>> |Take over (something) and use it for a different purpose.| he argues that pressure groups have hijacked the environmental debate

Contradicting people doesn’t build relationships. Dale Carnegie said it many years ago — and modern neuroscience agrees.
When people hear things that contradict their beliefs, the logical part of their mind shuts down and their brain prepares to fight.
	> neuroscience
	> shut down

Via Compelling People: The Hidden Qualities That Make Us Influential:
	> compel == Force or oblige (someone) to do something.

So what happened in people’s brains when they saw information that contradicted their worldview in a charged political environment? As soon as they recognized the video clips as being in conflict with their worldview, the parts of the brain that handle reason and logic went dormant. And the parts of the brain that handle hostile attacks — the fight-or-flight response — lit up.
	> worldview == A particular philosophy of life or conception of the world.
	> charged
		>> |Having an electric charge|
		>> |Filled with excitement, tension, or emotion| the highly charged atmosphere created by the boycott
	> dormant
	> fight-or-flight response 戰鬥或逃跑反應 == hyperarousal == acute stress response == a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival
	> light up == (of a person's face or eyes) suddenly become animated with liveliness or joy.

So you’ve stopped trying to be clever. But how do you get a reputation as a great listener?

3) How To Be A Good Listener

We’ve all heard that listening skills are vital but nobody explains the right way to do it. What’s the secret?
Stop thinking about what you’re going to say next and focus on what they’re saying right now.
Be curious and ask to hear more about what interests you.
Here’s Robin:

Listening isn’t shutting up. Listening is having nothing to say. There’s a difference there. If you just shut up, it means you’re still thinking about what you wanted to say. You’re just not saying it. The second that I think about my response, I’m half listening to what you’re saying because I’m really waiting for the opportunity to tell you my story.
What you do is this: as soon as you have that story or thought that you want to share, toss it. Consciously tell yourself, “I am not going to say it.”
All you should be doing is asking yourself, “What idea or thought that they mentioned do I find fascinating and want to explore?”
	> the second (that) == as soon as
		>> The second I saw him, I knew he was going to be a star.

Research shows just asking people to tell you more makes you more likable and gets them to want to help you.
The basics of active listening are pretty straightforward:

1. Listen to what they say. Don’t interrupt, disagree or “evaluate.”
2. Nod your head, and make brief acknowledging comments like “yes” and “uh-huh.”
3. Without being awkward, repeat back the gist of what they just said, from their frame of reference.
4. Inquire. Ask questions that show you’ve been paying attention and that move the discussion forward.
	> gist 要點 == The substance or general meaning of a speech or text.
	> reference
		>> |The action of mentioning or alluding to something.| he made reference to the enormous power of the mass media
		>> |A mention or citation of a source of information in a book or article.| each chapter should have references to books covering the subject in greater depth
		>> |A source of information cited in a book or article.|
		>> V |Provide (a book or article) with citations of sources of information.| each chapter is referenced, citing literature up to 1990
		>> V |Mention or refer to.| the media referenced our association in almost 40 articles
		>> |The use of a source of information in order to ascertain something.| popular works of reference
		>> |The sending of a matter to an authority for decision or consideration.| the publishers reprinted and sold the work without reference to the author
		>> |letter from a previous employer testifying to someone's ability or reliability, used when applying for a new job.| I was dismissed from the library, but with a good reference

I know, I know — some people are just boring. You’re not that interested in what they’re saying. So what questions do you ask then, smart guy?

4) The Best Question To Ask People

Life can be tough for everyone: rich or poor, old or young. Everyone.
We all face challenges and we like to talk about them. So that’s what to ask about.
Here’s Robin:

A great question I love is challenges. “What kind of challenges did you have at work this week? What kind of challenges do you have living in this part of the country? What kinds of challenges do you have raising teenagers?” Everyone has got challenges. It gets people to share what their priorities in life are at that point in time.
	>> at that point in time == At a particular moment in the past

Questions are incredibly powerful. What’s one of the most potent ways to influence someone? Merely asking for advice.
Via Adam Grant’s excellent Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success:

Studies demonstrate that across the manufacturing, financial services, insurance, and pharmaceuticals industries, seeking advice is among the most effective ways to influence peers, superiors, and subordinates. Advice seeking tends to be significantly more persuasive than the taker’s preferred tactics of pressuring subordinates and ingratiating superiors. Advice seeking is also consistently more influential than the matcher's default approach of trading favors.
	> pharmaceuticals == A compound manufactured for use as a medicinal drug.
	> subordinate
		>> ADJ |Lower in rank or position.| his subordinate officers
		>> |Of less or secondary importance.| in adventure stories, character must be subordinate to action
		>> N |A person under the authority or control of another within an organization.| he was mild-mannered, especially with his subordinates
		>> V |Treat or regard as of lesser importance than something else.| practical considerations were subordinated to political expediency
		>> V |Make subservient to or dependent on something else.| to define life would be to subordinate it to reason
	> ingratiate 迎合 == Bring oneself into favour with someone by flattering or trying to please them.
	> matcher == A person who matches one thing with another.

Twisting your mustache thinking you can use this for nefarious purposes? Wrong, Snidely Whiplash. It only works when you’re sincere.
	> mustache == A strip of hair left to grow above the upper lip.
	> nefarious == (typically of an action or activity) wicked or criminal.
		>> the nefarious activities of the organized-crime syndicates

Via Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success:

In her research on advice seeking, Liljenquist finds that success “depends on the target perceiving it as a sincere and authentic gesture.” When she directly encouraged people to seek advice as an influence strategy, it fell flat.
	> fall flat == fail completely to produce the intended or expected effect.

But what if you have to approach someone cold? How do you get people who might not want to talk to you to willingly give you their attention?

5) How To Make Strangers Feel At Ease

First thing: tell them you only have a minute because you’re headed out the door. 
	> head out
		>> |To leave some place; to depart.| Attention, everyone: we're heading out at 10 AM.
		>> |To move something away from something else.| If everyone is buckled in, I'll head the car out.
Here’s Robin:

When people think you’re leaving soon, they relax. If you sit down next to someone at a bar and say, “Hey, can I buy you a drink?” their shields go way up. It’s “Who are you, what do you want, and when are you leaving?” That “when are you leaving” is what you’ve got to answer in the first couple of seconds.

Research shows just asking people if now is a good time makes them more likely to comply with requests:
	> comply == Act in accordance with a wish or command

The results showed that compliance rates were higher when the requester inquired about respondents’ availability and waited for a response than when he pursued his set speech without waiting and inquiring about respondents’ availability.
	> inquire == enquire == Ask for information from someone
	> pursue
		>> |Follow or chase (someone or something)| the officer pursued the van
		>> |Seek to attain or accomplish (a goal) over a long period.| should people pursue their own happiness at the expense of others?
		>> |Continue or proceed along (a path or route)| the road pursued a straight course over the scrubland
		>> |Engage in (an activity or course of action)| Andrew was determined to pursue a computer career

Nobody wants to feel trapped talking to some weirdo. People are more likely to help you than you think, but they need to feel safe and in control.
	> weirdo == A person whose dress or behaviour seems strange or eccentric.
Even if you get all of the above right you can still come off like a shady used car salesman. And that fear stops you from meeting new awesome people.
	> come off
		>> |to happen as planned, or to succeed| There was some sort of property deal that didn't come off.
		>> |to stop taking something such as a medicine or drug| She’d been advised to come off the medication immediately.
		>> |to fall off something that you are riding| She’d come off her new bike and hurt her knee.
		>> |to stop being fixed to something| I pulled at the drawer, and the handle came off.
	> shady 
		>> |Situated in or full of shade| shady woods
		>> |Of doubtful honesty or legality.| he was involved in his grandmother's shady deals
Robin says one of the key reasons people come off as untrustworthy is because their words and their body language are misaligned. Let’s fix that.

6) The Best Body Language For Building Rapport

Your words should be positive, free of ego and judgment — and your body language (“non-verbals”) needs to match.
Here are the things Robin recommends:
	> non-verbal == Not involving or using words or speech.

1. “The number one thing is you’ve gotta smile. You absolutely have to smile. A smile is a great way to engender trust.”
2. “Keep that chin angle down so it doesn’t appear like you’re looking down your nose at anyone. And if you can show a  little bit of a head tilt, that’s always wonderful.”
3. “You don’t want to give a full frontal, full body display. That could be very offensive to someone. Give a little bit of an angle.”
4. “Keep your palms up as you’re talking, as opposed to palms down. That says, “I’m hearing what you’re saying. I’m open to what your ideas are.”
5. “So I always want to make sure that I’m showing good, open, comfortable non-verbals. I just try to use high eyebrow elevations. Basically, anything going up and elevating is very open and comforting. Anything that is compressing: lip compression, eyebrow compression, where you’re squishing down, that’s conveying stress.”
	> chin 下巴
	> palm
		>> 棕梠 |An unbranched evergreen tree of tropical and warm regions, with a crown of very long feathered or fan-shaped leaves| 
		>> 手掌 |The inner surface of the hand between the wrist and fingers.|
		>> |Conceal (a small object) in the hand, especially as part of a trick or theft.| he would spin wild tales while palming your wristwatch
		>> |(of a goalkeeper) deflect (the ball) with the palm of the hand.| Jason palmed the ball out of danger
	> compress 壓縮 == Flatten by pressure; squeeze or press

Research backs him up. From Dale Carnegie to peer-reviewed studies, everyone says smiles matter. (In fact, to increase their power, smile slower.)
It makes us happier too. Neuroscience research shows smiling gives the brain as much pleasure as 2000 bars of chocolate — or $25,000.
	> back sb up
		>> |to support or help someone| My family backed me up in my fight for compensation
		>> |to say that someone is telling the truth| That’s exactly what happened – Cleo will back me up.
	> bars of chocolate

Via Smile: The Astonishing Powers of a Simple Act:

Depending on whose smile you see, the researchers found that one smile can be as pleasurable and stimulating as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate! …it took up to 16,000 pounds sterling in cash to generate the same level of brain stimulation as one smile! This is equivalent to about $25,000 per smile…
	> sterling == British money.

So now you come off as the pleasant person you are, not as a scheming taker. But what do you do when the other person is a scheming taker?
	> scheming
		>> 詭計多端的 |Given to or involved in making secret and underhand plans.| they had mean, scheming little minds
		>> |The activity or practice of making secret and underhand plans.|

7) How To Deal With Someone You Don’t Trust

The name of this blog is not “Helpful Tools For Sociopaths.” I’m not trying to teach you to manipulate others.
But what should do you do when you feel someone is using these methods to try and manipulate you?
Don’t be hostile but be direct: ask them what they want. What are their goals in this interaction?
	> sociopath 反社會之人 == A person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behaviour.
Here’s Robin:

The first thing I try to do is clarify goals. I’ll stop and say, “You’re throwing a lot of good words at me. Obviously you’re very skilled at what you’re doing. But what I’m really curious about… What’s your goal? What are you trying to achieve? I’m here with my goals, but obviously you have to achieve your goals. So if you can just tell me what your objectives are, we can start from there and see if we can mutually take care of them. If not, that’s fine too.”
I watch for validation. If someone is trying to validate me and my thoughts and opinions, I am alert to it. I love doing that as well. So now I’m looking for intent. Are you there for me or are you there for you? If you are there strictly for your own gain and you’re not talking in terms of my priorities ever, that’s when I’m seeing someone is there to manipulate me.
	> in terms of 

Want to build a connection with someone? Focus on trust, not tricks. That’s how you earn respect. Trust is fragile. And mistrust is self-fulfilling.
When you ask people what the most important character trait is, what do they say? Trustworthiness.

Participants in 3 studies considered various characteristics for ideal members of interdependent groups (e.g., work teams, athletic teams) and relationships (e.g., family members, employees). Across different measures of trait importance and different groups and relationships, trustworthiness was considered extremely important for all interdependent others…
	> interdependent == (of two or more people or things) dependent on each other.

That’s a lot more to digest than “Just be yourself” but far more effective. Let’s round it up and make it something you can start using today.
	> far more
	> round sb/sth up == To gather or organize a group of people or things together.
		>> Would you mind rounding up the students so we can start the recital?

Sum Up

Here are Robin’s tips:

1. The single most important thing is non-judgmental validation. Seek someone else’s thoughts and opinions without judging them.
2. Suspend your ego. Focus on them.
3. Really listen, don’t just wait to talk. Ask them questions; don’t try to come up with stories to impress.
4. Ask people about what’s been challenging them.
5. Establishing a time constraint early in the conversation can put strangers at ease.
6. Smile, chin down, blade your body, palms up, open and upward non-verbals.
7. If you think someone is trying to manipulate you, clarify goals. Don’t be hostile or aggressive, but ask them to be straight about what they want.

Robin’s a fascinating guy and we ended up speaking for over an hour, so the above is just part of what he had to say.
