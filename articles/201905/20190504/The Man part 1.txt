The Man Who’s Going to Save Your Neighborhood Grocery Store
American food supplies are increasingly channeled through a handful of big companies: Amazon, Walmart, FreshDirect, Blue Apron. What do we lose when local supermarkets go under? A lot — and Kevin Kelley wants to stop that.

In 2014, Rich Niemann, president and CEO of the Midwestern grocery company Niemann Foods, made the most important phone call of his career. He dialed the Los Angeles office of Shook Kelley, an architectural design firm, and admitted he saw no future in the traditional grocery business. He was ready to put aside a century of family knowledge, throw away all his assumptions, completely rethink his brand and strategy — whatever it would take to carry Niemann Foods deep into the 21st century.
    > make a phone call
    > put aside == to ignore or not deal with something
    > throw away

“I need a last great hope strategy,” he told Kevin Kelley, the firm’s cofounder and principal. “I need a white knight.”

Part square-jawed cattle rancher, part folksy CEO, Niemann is the last person you’d expect to ask for a fresh start. He’s spent his whole life in the business, transforming the grocery chain his grandfather founded in 1917 into a regional powerhouse with more than 100 supermarkets and convenience stores across four states. In 2014, he was elected chair of the National Grocery Association. It’s probably fair to say no one alive knows how to run a grocery store better than Rich Niemann. Yet Niemann was no longer sure the future had a place for stores like his.
    > ranch == A large farm where cattle or other animals are bred. 
    > folksy
        >> |Having the characteristics of traditional culture and customs| the shop's folksy, small-town image
        >> |Informal and unpretentious.| his folksy, direct style
    > elect
        >> elect as sth
        >> elect sth

He was right to be worried. The traditional American supermarket is dying. It’s not just Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods, an acquisition that trade publication Supermarket News says marked “a new era” for the grocery business — or the fact that Amazon hopes to launch a second new grocery chain in 2019, according to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, with a potential plan to scale quickly by buying up floundering supermarkets. Even in plush times, grocery is a classic “red ocean” industry, highly undifferentiated and intensely competitive. (The term summons the image of a sea stained with the gore of countless skirmishes.) Now, the industry’s stodgy old playbook — “buy one, get one” sales, coupons in the weekly circular — is hurtling toward obsolescence. And with new ways to sell food ascendant, legacy grocers like Rich Niemann are failing to bring back the customers they once took for granted. You no longer need grocery stores to buy groceries.
    > marked
        >> |Clearly noticeable.| a marked increase in UK sales
        >> |Having a visible mark or marking.| a houseplant with beautifully marked, dark green leaves
    > buy up == to buy all of something or as much of it as you can get
    > flounder == to struggle or stagger clumsily in mud or water.
    > plush == richly luxurious and expensive.
    > stodgy ==  Dull and uninspired
    > hurtle == Move or cause to move at high speed
    > obsolescence == The process of becoming obsolete or outdated and no longer used. 
    > ascendant == Rising in power or influence.
    > take for granted == to never think about something because you believe it will always be available or stay exactly the same

Niemann hired Kelley in the context of this imminent doom. The assignment: to conceive, design, and build the grocery store of the future. Niemann was ready to entertain any idea and invest heavily. And for Kelley, a man who’s worked for decades honing his vision for what the grocery store should do and be, it was the opportunity of a lifetime — carte blanche to build the working model he’s long envisioned, one he believes can save the neighborhood supermarket from obscurity.
    > imminent == About to happen.
    > entertain
        > |Provide (someone) with amusement or enjoyment|
        > |Give attention or consideration to| Washington entertained little hope of an early improvement in relations
    > hone == Refine or perfect (something) over a period of time.
    > carte blanche == Complete freedom to act as one wishes

The store that resulted is called Harvest Market, which opened in 2016. It’s south of downtown Champaign, Illinois, out by the car dealerships and strip malls; 58,000 square feet of floor space mostly housed inside a huge, high-ceilinged glass barn. Its bulk calls to mind both the arch of a hayloft and the heavenward jut of a church. But you could also say it’s shaped like an ark, because it’s meant to survive an apocalypse.
    > bulk == the mass or size of something large.
    > hayloft == A loft over a stable used for storing hay or straw. 
    > heavenward == Directed or moving towards heaven or the sky; upward 
    > jut == A point that sticks out.
    > ark == the ship built by Noah to save his family and two of every kind of animal from the Flood

Harvest Market is the anti-Amazon. It’s designed to excel at what e-commerce can’t do: convene people over the mouth-watering appeal of prize ingredients and freshly prepared food. The proportion of groceries sold online is expected to swell over the next five or six years, but Harvest is a bet that behavioral psychology, spatial design, and narrative panache can get people excited about supermarkets again. Kelley isn’t asking grocers to be more like Jeff Bezos or Sam Walton. He’s not asking them to be ruthless, race-to-the-bottom merchants. In fact, he thinks that grocery stores can be something far greater than we ever imagined — a place where farmers and their urban customers can meet, a crucial link between the city and the country.
But first, if they’re going to survive, Kelley says, grocers need to start thinking like Alfred Hitchcock.
    > excel at == Be exceptionally good at or proficient in an activity or subject.
    > spatial /ˈspeɪʃ(ə)l/ == Relating to or occupying space.
