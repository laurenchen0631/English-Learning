The idea of “the squad” was over. Now it’s got bigger goals than ever.

It took four years, but there’s a new “it” squad and it’s taking applications.
	- squad
		> 小隊 |A small group of people having a particular task.| an assassination squad
		> 班/小組 |A small number of soldiers assembled for drill or assigned to a special task.| the demolition squad from No. 6 Troop were blowing up the guns
		> 運動隊 |A group of sports players from which a team is chosen.| Ireland's World Cup squad
		> 小組 |A division of a police force dealing with a particular type of crime.| the vice squad
		> 親友圈 |A person's circle of close friends.| the 39-year-old actress and her squad snapped some pics together after the show
It had seemed that “squads,” as made infamous by Taylor Swift circa 2015, had gone the way of “on fleek” and “lit.” Not long after the term made the jump from hip-hop culture to a broader (whiter and older) audience, it had already overstayed its welcome. The once ubiquitous #squadgoals hashtags grew few and far between.

	- circa (尤用於年份)大約 == (used especially with years) approximately
		> He was born circa 1600.
	- on fleek 到位/很完美/很正點 == on point
	- lit 非常興奮/非常熱門 == When something is turned up or popping 
	- overstay 停留得過久 == Stay longer than the time, limits, or duration of.
	- few and far between 稀有/難得 == not very many or not appearing very frequently
		> Sunny, warm weekends have been few and far between this summer.
	- squad goals == Goals to achieve with your group of friends, your 'squad'
Fast forward to this week, when four progressive women lawmakers leaned into their nickname, “the squad,” to present a united front against President Trump.
	- lean into
		> 擁抱/接受 |The act of embracing something, or a situation, by using it to empower yourself| He was often self conscious about having red hair, but recently he decided to lean into it and really prided himself on it being his look
		> 推擠/擠入 |To push into or press against someone or something.| People in the audience behind me kept leaning into me throughout the concert.
“Our squad is big,” Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts said during a news conference on Monday with Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan by her side. “Our squad includes any person committed to creating a more equitable and just world.”
Last night, at a rally in North Carolina, Mr. Trump described them as “hate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down,” and invited them to leave the country.

Is a Squad Infantilizing?

As usage of “the squad” picked up in the news and across social media, the groans began too.
	- infantilize 把..當成小孩般對待 == Treat (someone) as a child or in a way which denies their maturity in age or experience.
	* groan
		> 呻吟 |Make a deep inarticulate sound conveying pain, despair, pleasure, etc.| Marty groaned and pulled the blanket over his head
		> 呻吟聲 |A deep inarticulate sound conveying pain, despair, pleasure, etc.| she lay back with a groan
		> 抱怨 |Complain; grumble.| they were moaning and groaning about management
		> 抱怨 |A complaint.| listen to everyone's moans and groans
		> 發吱嘎聲 |(of an object) make a low creaking sound when pressure or weight is applied.| James slumped back into his chair, making it groan
		> 吱嘎聲  |A low creaking sound made by an object under pressure.| the protesting groan of timbers
Moira Donegan, a Guardian columnist, wrote on Twitter Monday that it struck her as “mildly sexist and infantilizing” to refer to them as the squad while they endured “racist abuse.”
	- sexist /ˈsɛksɪst/ (adj)性別歧視的 (n)有性別歧視的人
Sean Burns, a film critic, tweeted that he had nothing but respect and admiration for the group. “But do I really have to call them The Squad?” he added. “That sounds so embarrassing when I say it.”
Yet the name started with the congresswomen themselves. Last November, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez posted a picture to Instagram of herself, Ms. Omar, Ms. Pressley and Ms. Tlaib smiling in a Washington, D.C. conference room with a simple caption: “Squad.” Ms. Pressley called the group a squad in her own Instagram story that same day.
This did not go unnoticed by the press.

Gangs, Caucuses and Squads

Lawmakers often coalesce into “gangs” (bipartisan groups that tackle tough issues like immigration) or “caucuses” (ideological, ethnic or policy-specific interest groups like the House Freedom Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus or the Pollinator Protection Caucus). But “the squad” captures the group’s disruptive relationship to the status quo in Washington. Not only are all four members part of a wave of Democratic women and people of color who won seats in 2018 midterm elections, they’re also a lot younger. The average age of the squad is 38.3 years, while the average age of all House members in the 116th Congress is 57.6 years.
Youth, apparently, isn’t a requirement. On Tuesday, The Onion tweeted a satirical article in which Representative Bill Pascrell, an 82-year-old Democrat from New Jersey, asked Ms. Omar if he could join the squad. Then Mr. Pascrell really did ask to be part of the team. Ms. Omar tweeted a gif of Snoop Dogg nodding, captioned “OH FO SHO.” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote back: “you’re in.”
	- The Onion 洋蔥報，一家擁有報紙和網站的新聞機構，除了一個娛樂性的欄目「A.V. Club」非常有名以外，他們還以諷刺刊登在網上和報紙上的文章而有很高的知名度。
	- oh fo sho == oh for sure.

Taylor Swift and Hip-Hop History

In May 2015, Taylor Swift released the music video for her song “Bad Blood,” as a tribute, of sorts, to the collection of Victoria’s Secret models, actresses and other famous, glamorous women she’d become friendly with over the years. They were her squad, and their collective energy was squad goals. (The song is about having enemies; one ostensibly vanquishes one’s enemies with one’s squad.)
	- glamorous 富有魅力的 == Having glamour.
	- ostensibly 表面上 == As appears or is stated to be true, though not necessarily so; apparently.
The association of “squad” and “squad goals” with Ms. Swift drew calls of appropriation at the time, as the term, adopted at some point from its militaristic milieu, had long been used by many hip-hop and R&B artists. The ’90s and 2000s saw the formation — and disbandment — of groups like the Hit Squad and Flipmode Squad. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s home borough, the Bronx, was also the launchpad for Terror Squad, Fat Joe’s group that gave us the 2004 classic “Lean Back.”
	- appropriation
		> 挪用 |The action of appropriating something.| dishonest appropriation of property
		> 挪用/盜用 |The deliberate reworking of images and styles from earlier, well-known works of art.| the hallmark of postmodernism has turned out to be appropriation
		> 撥款 |A sum of money allocated officially for a particular use.| success in obtaining appropriations for projects
	- disbandment 團體的解散 == The breaking up of an organized group.
	- borough (n)自治市鎮, 區
	- launchpad 發射台
Squads are still a part of hip-hop and R&B. On her May 2019 album “Beauty Marks,” Ciara sings “girl gang, girl gang, squad goals, bang bang” on “Girl Gang,” featuring Kelly Rowland.
The new squad in D.C. is then a little bit old and a little bit new. It’s a catchy shorthand that signals youth and unity and identity. It invites membership, which seems like a plus for fund-raising emails or rallies. But the term still conveys some measure of self-defense. A squad has allegiance to itself — and its goals — because it has something important to protect.
	- catchy 引起注意的/動聽而易記的 == (of a tune or phrase) instantly appealing and memorable.
	- shorthand
		> 速記法 |A method of rapid writing by means of abbreviations and symbols, used especially for taking dictation. The major systems of shorthand currently in use are those devised in 1837 by Sir Isaac Pitman and (in the US) in 1888 by John R. Gregg (1867–1948)|
		> 簡略的表達方式 |A short and simple way of expressing or referring to something.|
