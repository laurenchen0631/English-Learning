The Guide to Getting Into Madonna, Holy Mother of Modern Pop
She's a true original with a decades-deep catalog, so ahead of the release of 'Madame X,' here's a streamlined guide to her restlessly creative and game-changing career.

Though Madonna’s been called the “Queen of Pop” for the majority of her 37-year recording career, in a way she’s also strangely underrated. "People have always been trying to silence me for one reason or another, whether it’s that I’m not pretty enough, I don’t sing well enough, I’m not talented enough, I’m not married enough — and now it’s that I’m not young enough," she told British Vogue recently.
	+ in a way 在某種意義上 == considered in a particular manner
		> In a way, I hope he doesn’t win.
But since 1978, when she relocated from Bay City, Michigan to New York with just $35 in her pocket, according to legend, Madonna has insisted on speaking her truth. “I’m tough, I’m ambitious, and I know exactly what I want. If that makes me a bitch, okay,” she famously said in a 1992 People interview. Her ability to adopt different personas and attention-grabbing scandals have been well-documented, even when critics haven’t fully appreciated the creative risks they involve. Her 1992 Sex book remains the only glossy coffee table tome to show a pop superstar simulating S&M and analingus. Because Madonna is a button-pushing figure whose body has been scrutinized as much as her work, her music’s sheer pop brilliance often gets sidelined, too.
	- analingus == anilingus 舔肛
	- sideline
		> 副業 |An activity done in addition to one's main job, especially to earn extra income.|
		> 球場界線 |Either of the two lines bounding the longer sides of a football field, basketball court, tennis court, or similar playing area.|
		> 界外場地 |The area immediately outside either sideline as a place for non-players, substitutes, or spectators.|
		> 使退場 |Cause (a player) to be unable to play in a team or game.| an ankle injury has sidelined him for two weeks
		> 退出第一線 |Remove from the centre of activity or attention; place in a less influential position.| backbench MPs have been sidelined and excluded from decision-making
Feminist author Germaine Greer claimed in 2006 that Madonna’s real genius lies in marketing, writing, "She has always kept an ear out for whatever was happening on the underground. The trick was to recognize what could be commercialized and to go ahead and do it.” Madonna’s ability to recalibrate cutting-edge culture for a mainstream audience is definitely worth celebrating, but this talent has sometimes led to accusations of cultural appropriation. Her 1990 smash “Vogue” was inspired by the buoyant house tracks and glamorous dance moves of the Harlem ballroom scene. It was a shrewd move, superbly executed with an iconic video, but critics have argued that by name-checking an all-white list of Hollywood icons in her lyrics, Madonna was “erasing voguing’s original context as a creation of queer people of color."
	- cultural appropriation 文化挪用 == the act of taking or using things from a culture that is not your own, especially without showing that you understand or respect this culture
	- ballroom 舞廳 == A large room for formal dancing.
At the same time, Greer’s assessment of Madonna’s skillset feels, well, reductive – to borrow a term that Madonna deployed when asked about perceived musical similarities between her 1989 hit “Express Yourself” and Lady Gaga’s 2011 single “Born This Way.” As co-writer and co-producer of the vast majority of songs she’s released since her 1982 debut single “Everybody,” Madonna has built one of contemporary pop’s most impressive songwriting catalogs. "Someone who you might not think of as the world’s best lyricist is Madonna," Pet Shop Boys' Neil Tennant said last year, "but she always gets the emphasis on the right syllable.” Stuart Price, Madonna’s main collaborator on 2005’s excellent, club-ready album Confessions on a Dance Floor, praised her “inherent understanding of dance music and pop music.”
	- reductive
		> 簡化的 |Tending to present a subject or problem in a simplified form, especially one viewed as crude.| such a conclusion by itself would be reductive
		> 化學還原的 |Relating to chemical reduction|
	- syllable
		> 音節 |A unit of pronunciation having one vowel sound, with or without surrounding consonants, forming the whole or a part of a word; for example, there are two syllables in water and three in inferno.|
		> 發音清晰 |Pronounce (a word or phrase) clearly, syllable by syllable.|
		> 絲毫 |The least amount of speech or writing; the least mention of something.| 'd never have breathed a syllable if he'd kept quiet
Confessions is one of three stone-cold classic LPs in Madonna’s oeuvre; the others are 1989’s deeply personal pop masterpiece Like a Prayer and 1998’s forward-thinking electro opus Ray of Light. And her original greatest hits compilation, 1990’s The Immaculate Collection, is as close to flawless as pop music gets. But with Madonna about to drop her 14th studio album, Madame X, which critics are hailing as her most “bizarre” and “daring” ever, it’s the perfect time to reconsider the music that’s made her a pop culture colossus, longtime LGBTQ icon, and the fourth-best-selling artist of all time.
	- stone-cold == very or completely cold
	- opus 著作 == A separate composition or set of compositions.
	- immaculate
		> 潔淨的 |Perfectly clean, neat, or tidy.| an immaculate white suit
		> 完美的 |Free from flaws or mistakes; perfect.| an immaculate safety record
		> 沒有斑點的 |Uniformly coloured without spots or other marks.|
Because her decades-deep catalog can be daunting to navigate, especially outside of those classic albums, we put together a streamlined guide to some of the most enduring moments in her restlessly creative and game-changing career. If you still think Madonna’s kind of overrated after listening to these tracks, then take a tip from Britney Spears. "I'm sorry, but I'd rather meet Madonna than the President of the United States,” the younger pop star wrote in 2004. “Madonna was the first female pop star to take control of every aspect of her career and to take responsibility for creating her image, no matter how much flak she might get."
	- flak
		> 防空炮 |Anti-aircraft fire.|
		> 批評/抨擊 |Strong criticism.| you must be strong enough to take the flak if things go wrong

So you want to get into: Pure Pop Madonna?

This playlist could be longer — much longer. Madonna’s first couple albums yielded the instant-classic hits "Borderline," "Lucky Star," "Material Girl," and "Like a Virgin." "Virgin" is often painted as Madonna’s first scandalous moment, partly because she writhed on the floor in a wedding dress when she performed it at the 1984 VMAs. But I've always found "Borderline" every bit as suggestive, probably because my mom insisted that the lyrics are "really about reaching orgasm, you know." I'll leave you to decide whether you agree with her sex-positive interpretation.
	- writhe 扭曲 == Make twisting, squirming movements or contortions of the body.
	- writhe in/with/at 苦惱/不安 == Respond with great emotional or physical discomfort to (an intense or unpleasant feeling or thought)
		> she bit her lip, writhing in suppressed fury
	- orgasm (n/v)性高潮 == The climax of sexual excitement
Her third album, 1986’s True Blue, is one of the most enjoyable pop collections of its era, home to the iconic bops "Open Your Heart," "Papa Don’t Preach," and "La Isla Bonita." By this point, Madonna had become known for a certain kind of perky and super-melodic pop tune, but she was already beginning to push its limits: The album's title track is a joyous 60s girl-group homage that she revived on 2015’s Rebel Heart Tour.
	- bop 波普爵士樂
	- perky
		> 活潑的/神氣的 |Cheerful and lively.| she certainly looked less than her usual perky self
		> 厚顏無恥的 |Cheeky| don't be perky, miss!
	- homage 尊敬/崇敬 == Special honour or respect shown publicly.
Follwing 1989's musically rich and inventive Like a Prayer album, which dazzled listeners with its still-ubiquitous title track as well as feminist rallying cry "Express Yourself," kept churning out pop hooks: Check out the killer chorus on 2005’s "Jump." But many of her career highlights from the 90s onwards saw her delve deeper into dance music and electronica, even when the unshakable choruses kept on coming. Some exceptions are "Secret," a lovely folky number from 1994’s Bedtime Stories; 1999 psychedelic gem "Beautiful Stranger"; and Madame X promo single "Crave," an appealingly hazy collaboration with Rae Sremmurd’s Swae Lee that boasts one of Madonna’s stickiest melodies in years.
	- rallying
		> 聚眾支持 |The action or process of coming together to support a person or cause.| the rallying of public opinion in support of these objectives
		> 拉力賽 |The sport or action of participating in a motor rally.| established names in international rallying
		> 煽動性的 |Having the effect of calling people to action.| a rallying cry
	- churn
		> 攪乳器 |A machine for making butter by shaking milk or cream.|
		> 攪拌 |Shake (milk or cream) in a machine in order to produce butter.| the cream is ripened before it is churned
		> 翻騰 |(with reference to liquid) move or cause to move about vigorously.| her stomach was churning at the thought of the ordeal
		> 隆起 |Break up the surface of (an area of ground)| the earth had been churned up where vehicles had passed through
		> |(of a broker) encourage frequent turnover of (investments) in order to generate commission.|
	- delve
		> 跳入 |Reach inside a receptacle and search for something.| she delved in her pocket
		> 探究 |Research or make painstaking inquiries into something.| the society is determined to delve deeper into the matter
	- electronica 電子樂
	- psychedelic 幻覺的 == Relating to or denoting drugs (especially LSD) that produce hallucinations and apparent expansion of consciousness.
	- hazy
		> 有薄霧的 |Covered by a haze| it was a beautiful day but quite hazy’
		> 模糊的 |Vague or ill-defined.| hazy memories
		> 困惑的 |Confused; uncertain.| school-leavers were often hazy about employment

So you want to get into: Club Queen Madonna?

Deciding whether some Madonna songs are more "pop" or "dance" feels kind of arbitrary. Any wedding DJ will tell you that "Like a Prayer" fills the floor every time, and she's scored a record 46 number-ones on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. Quite simply, clubbing is in Madonna's musical DNA: Before she smashed into the mainstream with 1982's "Holiday," she was a regular at legendary New York City nightspot Danceteria, where she persuaded DJ Mark Kamins to play her post-disco debut single "Everybody" and later gave her first ever live performance.
With all this in mind, I've picked 13 Madonna songs that sparkle particularly brightly in a space where communal dancing is possible: the club, say, or your kitchen after a couple glasses of Chardonnay. Recorded for Madonna's first and arguably best movie, Desperately Seeking Susan, 1985's blissful "Into the Groove" almost feels like a manifesto: "Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free," Madonna sings euphorically. A few years later, her early 90s collaborations with DJ/producer Shep Pettibone produced some heady house bangers — you surely know "Vogue," but "Deeper and Deeper" and "Rescue Me" are equally sinewy and thrilling.
	- Chardonnay 夏多內，現在在全世界範圍內廣泛種植號稱葡萄皇后。可以釀造變化多端的白葡萄酒
	- manifesto 宣言 == A public declaration of policy and aims, especially one issued before an election by a political party or candidate.
	- euphoric 愉快的/興奮的 == Characterized by or feeling intense excitement and happiness.
	- heady
		> 烈的 |(of alcoholic drink) potent; intoxicating.| several bottles of heady local wine
		> 興奮的 |Having a strong or exhilarating effect.| a heady, exotic perfume
	- banger
		> |An old car in poor condition.|
		> |A loud explosive firework.|
		> |an energetic song that is very striking or extraordinary| 
It may be more than two decades old, but the title track from 1998's Ray of Light still slaps remarkably hard, and 2005's "Hung Up" remains a masterstroke. Who else but Madonna would think to build a shimmering club banger around an ABBA sample — then persuade the Swedish pop supremos, notoriously protective of their own music, to grant her permission to use it? "Get Together" — a fan favorite from the same album, Confessions on a Dance Floor — even earned a Grammy nomination in the Best Dance Recording category; ace singer-songwriter Shura recently confessed that she jammed it non-stop on a bus from Lima to Buenos Aires.
	* shimmer
	- supremo 大師 == A person with great authority or skill in a certain area.
	- Grammy 葛萊美獎
	- jam
		> 擠入 |Squeeze or pack tightly into a specified space.| ‘four of us were jammed in one compartment
		> 使長時間忙線 |Cause (telephone lines) to be continuously engaged with a large number of calls.|
		> 使塞住 |Become or make unable to move or work due to a part seizing up or becoming stuck.|
		> |An instance of a thing seizing or becoming stuck.| paper jams
		> 干擾 |Make (a broadcast or other electronic signal) unintelligible by causing interference.|
		> 即興創作 |Improvise with other musicians, especially in jazz or blues.|
		> 尷尬的處境 |An awkward situation or predicament.| I'm in a jam
More recently, 2012's patchy MDNA album produced an underrated EDM thumper in "I'm Addicted," and "Living for Love," from 2015’s messy but sometimes magical Rebel Heart LP, shows Madonna’s unflagging passion for making people move. Co-producer Diplo revealed that he and Madonna went through around 20 different mixes before settling on the housey final version.
	- thumper (n)重擊者, 龐然大物/巨人
	- messy
		> 髒的 |Untidy or dirty.|
		> 麻煩的 |Generating or involving mess.| stripping wallpaper can be a messy, time-consuming job
		> 混亂的 |(of a situation) confused and difficult to deal with.|

So you want to get into: Balladeer Madonna?

Madonna is best known for her bangers, but by 1995, she already had enough superior slowies to release a ballads compilation, Something to Remember. "You’ll See," recorded expressly for that album, is so classy and dramatic, it was even covered by Susan Boyle. Yes, really.
	- slowie
While she’s never been a vocal powerhouse like her 80s contemporary Whitney Houston, Madonna demonstrated her ability to carry a ballad early on. In his review of 1986’s True Blue album, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine hails "Live to Tell" as a "tremendous ballad that rewrites the rules of adult contemporary crossover." On "Oh Father," from Like a Prayer, Madonna explores her difficult relationship with her dad; on "In This Life," from 1992’s Erotica, she mourns friends and mentors taken by AIDS. "Have you ever watched your best friend die – what for?" she sings, remembering her former roommate Martin Burgoyne, who'd died of the disease six years earlier.
	- crossover
		> 天橋/平交道 |A point or place of crossing from one side to the other.|
		> 成名 |The process of achieving success in a different field or style, especially in popular music.|
		> 交叉 |Relating to or denoting trials of medical treatment in which experimental subjects and control groups are exchanged after a set period.| a crossover study
"The Power of Good-Bye" from Ray of Light is simply stunning, and "Nothing Fails," from 2003’s American Life album, is arguably the great Madonna hit that got away. When a gospel choir unexpectedly comes in at the climax, it makes your arm hair stand on end. Fans also love "Joan of Arc" from Rebel Heart, partly because its lyrics are among Madonna's most revealing. "Each time they write a hateful word, dragging my soul into the dirt, I wanna die," she sings, proving that even the Queen of Pop can be vulnerable to criticism.
	- gospel 福音 == The teaching or revelation of Christ.
	- choir 唱詩班 == An organized group of singers, especially one that takes part in church services or performs in public.

So you want to get into: R&B Diva Madonna?

Madonna has leaned heavily into R&B on two albums: 1994's Bedtime Stories, which contains collaborations with TLC producer Dallas Austin, and 2008's Hard Candy, on which she teamed up with Pharrell Williams and Timbaland. Bedtime Stories is no classic, but "Human Nature" is a fabulously unapologetic clapback to critics who slut-shamed her during the highly sexualized Erotica era. "You punished me for telling you my fantasies / I'm breaking all the rules I didn't make," she seethes.
	- unapologetic 不後悔的 == Not acknowledging or expressing regret.
	- clapback == A quick reply to a critical remark or unfair treatment.
	- slut-shamed 蕩婦羞辱，一個概念用來描述使一個人，尤其是女性，為自己的某種性行為或性慾感到羞恥或低人一等的行為。
	- erotica 情色作品 == Erotic literature or art.
	- seethe
		> 沸騰/翻騰 |(of a liquid) boil or be turbulent as if boiling.|
		> 慍怒 |(of a person) be filled with intense but unexpressed anger.| inwardly he was seething at the slight to his authority
		> 充滿 |(of a place) be crowded with people or things moving about in a rapid or hectic way.| the entire cellar was seething with spiders
		> 快速移動 |(of a crowd of people) move in a rapid or hectic way.| we cascaded down the stairs and seethed across the station
Hard Candy isn't first-rate Madonna, either: she recruited Timbaland after he’d produced huge hits for Nelly Furtado ("Promiscuous") and Justin Timberlake ("Cry Me a River"), so it felt at the time as though she was chasing pop trends rather than setting them. Still, her own Timberlake duet "4 Minutes" is a worthy hit single, and the daring disco-filter house hybrid "She’s Not Me," co-produced by Pharrell, sounds like a song only Madonna could make. "I Don’t Give A," an electro-funk nugget from 2012's MDNA that features a brilliant Nicki Minaj rap, also works well here. Penned following her 2008 divorce from movie director Guy Ritchee, its rapid-fire lyrics offer a glimpse into Madonna's ridiculously hectic daily schedule as a single mom. "Wake up ex-wife, this is your life," she sings at the start of the song, followed by a shrugging "Lawyers, suck it up — didn’t have a pre-nup" on the second verse. Ouch.
	- nugget
		> 金礦 |A small lump of gold or other precious metal found ready-formed in the earth.|
		> 塊 |nuggets of meat| nuggets of meat
		> 有價值的東西或想法 |A valuable idea or fact.|
	- hectic 忙亂的 == Full of incessant or frantic activity.

So you want to get into: Experimental Madonna?

By bookending 1990's The Immaculate Collection with the sensual and poetic trip-hop gem "Justify My Love," Madonna was signaling her desire to push her music in unexpected new directions. And so she did: 1992's Erotica album may have been a relative flop at the time (it "only" went double-platinum in the US), but its seductive and surprisingly downbeat blend of electronica, hip-hop, deep house, and R&B makes it Madonna's most fascinating album. Check out the freaky break-up song "Bye Bye Baby," which smothers Madonna’s vocal in an effect that makes it sound like she's dumping someone in a voicemail. "You fucked it up," she informs him just before hanging up.
	- flop
	- smother
		> 使窒息 |Kill (someone) by covering their nose and mouth so that they suffocate.| I dreamt a stranger was trying to kill me by smothering me with a pillow
		> 使感覺窒息 |Make (someone) feel trapped and oppressed by acting in an overly protective manner towards them.| it's time for you to leave the house—she'll smother you if you remain
		> 悶熄 |Extinguish (a fire) by covering it.|
		> 壓抑 |Suppress (a feeling or action)| she smothered a sigh
	- smother sb/sth in/with 用...蓋住... == Cover someone or something entirely with.
		> rich orange sorbets smothered in fluffy whipped cream
Co-written by Björk, who said that the song tapped into "the things I have always wanted to hear Madonna say that she's never said," 1994's "Bedtime Story" must have seemed like an anomaly at the time. But in hindsight, the esoteric electro track feels like a dry run for 1998’s Ray of Light. That album’s sublime, swirling lead single "Frozen" would become a global smash, but "Drowned World/Substitute for Love," an ambient pop song where Madonna ponders the price of fame, is equally beguiling.
	- hindsight 後見之名 == Understanding of a situation or event only after it has happened or developed.
	- dry run 演習/排練 == a practice of a particular activity or performance
		> The day before the trial, the lawyers tried a dry run of the closing arguments.
After Ray of Light, Madonna made two albums (2000’s Music and 2003’s American Life) with French electro wiz Mirwais Ahmadzaï, with whom she would reconnect for Madame X. These contain some of her most challenging and thrilling music: with its glitchy beats and poetic lyrics, "Don’t Tell Me" is a country-pop crossover that sounds like no other country-pop crossover I've ever heard — no wonder Miley Cyrus likes it — and the electro-folk "Hollywood" contains a bracingly strange industrial breakdown.
Madonna's appetite for experimentation hasn’t dissipated: "Bitch I’m Madonna," from 2015's Rebel Heart, is a playful romp produced by Diplo and avant-pop artist SOPHIE. And "Dark Ballet," from Madame X, begins as an ominous piano ballad before incorporating a Tchaikovsky sample. Still, it feels most fitting to end this playlist with 2000's "Impressive Instant," an odd but catchy song about losing yourself on the dance floor, because it melds so many elements of what makes Madonna, well, Madonna. "You’re the one I’ve been waiting for," she purrs over a trippy techno throb. "I don’t even know your name." Oh Madonna, we’ve all been there.
	- dissipate
		> 消失/使消失 |(with reference to a feeling or emotion) disappear or cause to disappear.| the concern she'd felt for him had wholly dissipated
		> 散開 |Disperse or scatter.| the cloud of smoke dissipated
		> 揮霍 |Waste or fritter away (money, energy, or resources)| he inherited, but then dissipated, his father's fortune
	- romp
		> 亂蹦亂跳 |(especially of a child or animal) play roughly and energetically.|
		> |Proceed without effort to achieve something.|
		> |Engage in sexual activity, especially illicitly.|
		> |A spell of sexual activity, especially an illicit one.|
		> 嬉耍喧鬧 |A spell of rough, energetic play.|
		> |A light-hearted film or other work.|
		> |An easy victory.|
	- Tchaikovsky 柴可夫斯基
	- meld == Blend; combine.
	- purr
		> |(of a cat) make a low continuous vibratory sound expressing contentment.|
		> |(of a vehicle or engine) move smoothly while making a similar sound.|
		> |Speak in a low, soft voice, especially when expressing contentment or acting seductively.|
		> |A purring sound.|
	* trippy 不清醒的 == Resembling or inducing the hallucinatory effect produced by taking a psychedelic drug.
	- throb
		> 有節奏地敲 |Beat or sound with a strong, regular rhythm; pulsate steadily.| the war drums throbbed’
		> |A strong, regular beat or sound; a steady pulsation.|
		> 抽痛 |Feel pain in a series of regular beats.| her foot throbbed with pain
		> |A feeling of pain in a series of regular beats.|
