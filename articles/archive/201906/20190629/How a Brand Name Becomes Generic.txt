How a Brand Name Becomes Generic
Pass the Kleenex, please.

When you need to blow your nose, there’s a good chance you ask for a Kleenex, even if the box being handed to you doesn’t bear the Kimberly-Clark-owned Kleenex logo. When you use a brand name as a generic term, you’re using a proprietary eponym, or, more simply, a generic trademark. You’re probably familiar with this phenomenon, but there are more examples of it than you might realize.
	- blow your nose == to clean your nose by forcing air through it
		> He took out a handkerchief and blew his nose loudly.
	- Kleenex 舒潔
	+ proprietary
		> 所有人的/所有權的 |Relating to an owner or ownership.| the company has a proprietary right to the property
		> 專利的/專賣的 |(of a product) marketed under and protected by a registered trade name.|
	- eponym 同名 == A person after whom a discovery, invention, place, etc., is named or thought to be named.
	- proprietary eponym 通用商標
You may be aware of Kleenex, Velcro and ChapStick, but what about escalator? Or dumpster? Linoleum, zipper, trampoline? All of these are (or were) trademarks of companies whose products were so successful that they came to represent an entire category. And it can actually cause quite a problem for those companies.
	- Velcro 魔鬼氈
	- ChapStick 潤唇膏
	- dumpster 垃圾箱
	- Linoleum 合成地氈/油地氈
	- zipper 拉鍊
	- trampoline 蹦床
“Over time, a brand can be so famous and so ubiquitous that people associate that with the action,” said Michael N. Cohen, an intellectual property lawyer in Los Angeles. “In everyday usage, people start using that term.”
You may think nothing of it when you ask for a Band-Aid to cover a cut or scrape. But a company like Johnson & Johnson, which makes the world’s most famous brand of adhesive bandages, might have reason to worry because — theoretically, anyway — that degree of easy familiarity could put it in jeopardy of losing its trademark.
	- think nothing of 認為…容易/看輕 == to consider that an activity is easy and not unusual
		> When I was younger, I thought nothing of riding my bike 50 miles in a day.
“When something becomes so pervasive in everyday society as a result of its own fame, there’s an argument that it no longer represents the brand, it almost represents the action,” Mr. Cohen said. “So as a result of that, in trademark law, you cannot trademark things that are descriptive or generic in nature.”

Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co. was a seminal case in which Bayer lost its trademark for Aspirin to what experts now refer to as “genericide.” That 1921 case set the table for the modern standard that courts currently follow: If a brand name is understood by the public to refer broadly to a category of goods and services rather than a brand’s specific good or service, a company may be at risk of losing its trademark. Escalator, cellophane, and laundromat have all lost their trademark status to genericide.
	- seminal
		> 有發展性的 |Strongly influencing later developments.| his seminal work on chaos theory
		> 精液的 |Relating to or denoting semen.| the spermatozoa are washed to separate them from the seminal plasma
		> 種子的 |Relating to or derived from the seed of a plant.|
	- genericide 通用商標 == The process by which a brand name loses its distinctive identity as a result of being used to refer to any product or service of its kind.
	- laundromat 自助洗衣房
There are still plenty of familiar names that hold their trademarks. Bubble Wrap is a trademark of Sealed Air, Frisbee remains a trademark of Wham-O, and Velcro is trademarked by the company of the same name. There are generic terms for all these products, but when was the last time you packed a box with inflated cushioning, tossed a flying disc or attached anything using hook-and-loop fasteners?
	- Bubble Wrap 氣泡布 == inflated cushioning
	- Frisbee 飛盤 == flying disc 
	- hook-and-loop fastener 魔鬼氈
Some companies are fighting back against the generic use of their trademarks. For example, when you see a company using its brand as an adjective (“Use a Xerox copier”) rather than a verb (“Go Xerox this”), it is trying to prevent genericization. Companies may also avoid using the plural form of the trademarked word (favoring “Lego bricks,” for instance, over “Legos”). They may even use a distinctive typeface to make the trademark stand out.
	- Xerox (n/v)靜電複印法

Other brands have taken more conspicuous approaches.
	- conspicuous
		> 明顯的 |Clearly visible.| he was very thin, with a conspicuous Adam's apple
		> 引人注目的 |Attracting notice or attention.| he showed conspicuous bravery

“Some big companies have engaged in advertising campaigns to let the public be aware that their name is actually a trademark,” Mr. Cohen said. “Xerox had an advertisement that was in a magazine that literally said, ‘If the trademark is misused, it could come undone … please help us ensure it doesn’t.’”
	- engage in 參加/參與 == to take part in something
		> The two governments have agreed to engage in a comprehensive dialogue to resolve the problem.
	- come undone 忍不住大哭 == When something hits you out of left field and you can't help but cry. 
		> Something about the way she said "goodbye" made me come undone.
Xerox still has its trademark, as do Rollerblade and Clorox, both of which ran similar campaigns. Velcro even made a music video about the issue.
	- Rollerblade 直排輪
	- Clorox 高樂氏
It’s a paradox that brands with fanciful names that don’t otherwise exist in common language have stronger cases when applying for a trademark. But this strength can become a weakness when it comes to protecting the trademarks against genericization.
“Some of the names that are made-up words are the ones susceptible to being genericized, because there is no other way to describe it,” Mr. Cohen said. “They became so famous, people may accidentally associate that name with the action — like Xerox.” Mr. Cohen noted that it’s possible for a company to recapture a trademark if it can get consumers to associate the brand name with its specific product rather than the product category at large.
Ultimately, it’s unlikely that you care about the intellectual property struggles of large corporations, and you’ll probably keep saying “Kleenex” when you really just want a tissue. But those companies are fighting hard to make sure you don’t.
