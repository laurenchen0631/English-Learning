The Raisin Situation
One man wanted to change the raisin industry for the better. He got more than he bargained for.

FRESNO, Calif. — Millennials just weren’t eating raisins. So Sun-Maid, the century-old company with the iconic little red raisin boxes, hired someone to convince them that they should.
	> raisin /ˈreɪz(ə)n/ == A partially dried grape.

At 38, Harry Overly was decades younger than the tenured raisin man he replaced as the chief executive of Sun-Maid. But he had experience — as the North American head of the company that makes Bertolli olive oil, and in marketing roles at Wrigley and other food companies. He seemed suited to the job.
	> tenure
		>> |The conditions under which land or buildings are held or occupied| 
		>> |The holding of an office.|
		>> |Guaranteed permanent employment|
		>> |Give (someone) a permanent post, especially as a teacher or lecturer. | I had recently been tenured and then promoted to full professor
	> Harry Overly was decades younger than tenured raisin man (which) he replaced as the chief executive of Sun-Maid 
	> chief executive 首席執行官

When he came west, though, he was taken aback by the level of animosity he encountered in the U.S. raisin industry, the entirety of which is crammed into a few hundred square miles in California’s Central Valley.
	> be taken aback = to surprise or shock someone so much that they do not know how to behave for a short time:
	> cram
		>> |Completely fill (a place or container) to the point of overflowing.| the ashtray by the bed was crammed with cigarette butts
		>> |Study intensively over a short period of time just before an examination.| lectures were called off so students could cram for the semester finals’

Three months into his tenure, which began on Halloween of 2017, Mr. Overly attended a meeting of some raisin industry players in the back room of a restaurant in Fresno, Calif. This introduction left him shaken. “I’m not saying this lightly, because — you can read about this in different spots — people kind of think there’s this raisin mafia out there and that kind of stuff,” Mr. Overly said.

He said that he asked the group how they thought they could work together. “And the answer I got back was nothing short of collusion,” he said. While no one was proposing they take action, the anti-competitive tactics discussed in that back room, he said, were “completely illegal.”
	> be nothing short of == used to emphasize a situation, quality, or type of behaviour
	> collusion == secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy in order to deceive others.
	> While no one was proposing they take action, the anti-competitive tactics (discussed in that back room, he said, )were “completely illegal.” 雖然沒有人提議他們採取行動，但他說，在後面的房間討論的反競爭策略“完全是非法的”。

As he tried to make changes in the raisin industry and at his own company, Mr. Overly said he faced intimidation, harassing phone calls and multiple death threats. With his spouse in the last trimester of a pregnancy, Mr. Overly found a note shoved into a crack of his front door that warned: “you can’t run.”
	> trimester == A period of three months, especially as a division of the duration of pregnancy.
	> shove == Push (someone or something) roughly.

Mr. Overly installed a security system at his house in Fresno. At Sun-Maid headquarters, he and other executives discussed the necessity of active shooter trainings. As rumors about Mr. Overly’s motives swirled among raisin farmers, raisin packers and raisin bureaucrats, he became increasingly concerned about the safety of the raisins themselves. He feared that the current crop, drying from grapes to a wrinkly, shrunken state in bins on the Sun-Maid campus, would be set ablaze. It was their destruction by “fire, specifically,” that worried him, he said.
	> wrinkly == Having many lines or folds.
	> ablaze == Burning fiercely.

“What I figured out fast was that this was not an industry which was interested in figuring out how you grow the size of the pie,” he said. “It is one where they figure out how they just steal different slices of the pie from each other.”
	> grow the size of the pie

The Dancing of the Raisins

It makes sense that Sun-Maid and its competitors in the raisin sector, all working and living in the same water-hungry valley, might not be the best of friends. But the American raisin industry, which is estimated to be worth about $500 million, is particularly fractious. Other groups of farmers also band together to set prices; while raisin growers do that, they do not tend to cooperate on much else. That includes a reluctance to work together on raisin advertising, which is especially strange given that the raisin industry commissioned and paid for one of the world’s most recognizable advertising campaigns.
	> make sense == to be clear and easy to understand
		>> It makes sense to pay off your debts before you start trying to save money.
		>> It makes sense that Sun-Maid and its competitors in the raisin sector

The first California Dancing Raisins commercial debuted on television in the fall of 1986. You may recall the ad with their version of Marvin Gaye’s “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.” These anthropomorphic raisins, conceived as an R&B group in the Motown mold, were some of the first animated characters created with Claymation.
	> anthropomorphic == Relating to or characterized by anthropomorphism
		>> anthropomorphism 擬人 == The attribution of human characteristics or behaviour to a god, animal, or object. 
	> Claymation 黏土動畫

Seth Werner, the copywriter at the San Francisco agency Foote, Cone & Belding who created the concept, knew the spots were outrageously popular. He got a call from Paul McCartney’s assistant, asking for a taped copy of the ad so the Beatle could watch it on repeat. Nancy Reagan invited the raisins to the White House in 1988 for Christmas. Michael Jackson requested that he personally be raisinified by the inventor of Claymation, Will Vinton, for a raisin commercial that appeared in movie theaters. (“It was really quite a problem getting the character of the Michael Jackson raisin to be good enough for Michael to approve,” Mr. Werner said. He remembered that Mr. Vinton told him “‘Finally I put Janet’s nose on him and he loved it,’” referring to Mr. Jackson’s sister.)
	> outrageous == Shockingly bad or excessive.
	> the Beatle 披頭四樂團

Raisin sales spiked. But success bred discontent. Even as Sun-Maid benefited disproportionately from the ads as the biggest brand in town, Barry Kriebel, then the company’s president, worked to limit his competitors from profiting in the same manner. He was dead set on restricting the way that the dancing raisin was displayed on the packaging of other brands — and Sun-Maid, which now represents about 40 percent of the industry, was big enough to put the pressure on.
	> be dead set on == to be determined to do something

Barry Kriebel “and I fought like cats and dogs,” said Kalem Barserian, 81, the leader of the Raisin Bargaining Association, which represents raisin farmers as they negotiate prices with raisin processors, including Sun-Maid. (Mr. Barserian has known five different Sun-Maid chiefs — and has a long tenure as one of the most formidable men in Fresno.)

Mr. Kriebel prevailed, poisoning good feeling in the industry about the Dancing Raisins. In 1994, a majority of raisin packers petitioned to terminate the funding, halting the commercials. (Mr. Kriebel, who now works for John Vidovich, a major grower of pomegranates, pistachios, oranges and Sun-Maid raisins, declined to discuss this history.)

Another major incident that helped breed the mistrust that still festers in the raisin community culminated in a 2015 Supreme Court case that nearly leveled Fresno.
	> fester == (of a wound or sore) become septic; suppurate.
	> culminate == Reach a climax or point of highest development.

Marvin Horne, a small, sour man who had married into a raisin-growing family, was known as laconic and stubborn and nothing made him angrier than having to set aside some of his crop every year for the raisin reserve.
	> nothing ... than ...
	> set aside == to save something, usually money or time, for a special purpose

Raisin farming (like most kinds of farming) is risky. So, starting in the mid-20th century, raisin farmers began committing a significant share of their crop to a communal supply. This surplus was used to stabilize trade. (Some years, like in 2002, the year that sent Mr. Horne through the roof, growers were compelled to turn over almost half their crop.) Though raisin farmers do get paid for selling this supply, the money comes later, if at all.
	> communal == Shared by all members of a community; for common use.
	> surplus == An amount of something left over when requirements have been met; an excess of production or supply.
	> turn over == to give someone or something to someone in authority, especially because they have ordered you to 

So in 2002, Mr. Horne and his spouse, Laura, stopped sharing, and sued the government for taking their raisins without fairly compensating them. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in Mr. Horne’s favor, saying that the raisin reserve, in practice, constituted governmental appropriation of private property — illegal under the Fifth Amendment.
	> the Supreme Court 最高法院
	> the Fifth Amendment 第五修正案

To Mike Mikaelian, a third-generation raisin farmer, that was a fundamental misunderstanding, and a huge blow to the industry.

“When you first hear this story, you’re always thinking, ‘Oh that government screwing the poor farmers,’ all right?” Mr. Mikaelian said. “But what happened was it was the farmers that made these rules. All the government does is O.K. it or don’t O.K. it.”
	> screw
	 	>> |Cheat or swindle (someone), especially by charging them too much for something.| he loss of advertising contracts will amount to more than the few quid that they're trying to screw us for 

And through these years, demand for raisins has fallen. The number of acres given over to the Thompson seedless grape, traditionally grown for raisins, has been halved from 2000 to 2019. The U.S. used to provide 50 percent of the global raisin market. Now it’s down to about 20 percent. Turkey exports more raisins than America does. China, Iran and South Africa have become more competitive in this space.
	> provide market

Mr. Horne, who will turn 74 this year, knows he is not well-liked in raisin town, but he stands by his decision. “Those guys are still living in the old paradigm,” he said.
	> turn [age]

As times got bad, representatives for growers felt they had no choice but to push prices as high as possible.
