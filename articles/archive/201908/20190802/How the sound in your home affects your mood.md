The acoustic properties of our houses, offices and public spaces can have a major impact on how comfortable we find them and may even affect the way we behave.

Step into the underground concourses of New York’s Penn Station and you might just feel an uneasy sense of claustrophobia that’s hard to explain. Stroll across the hardwood floors at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC and a sense of calmness might descend on you. Why? Each of these buildings has its own unique voice – the way sound behaves in the structure.
	- concourse
		> 中央大廳 |A large open area inside or in front of a public building.| a station concourse
		> 群集 |A crowd or assembly of people.| a vast concourse of onlookers
		> 匯合/集合 |The action of coming together or meeting.| the concourse of bodies
	- claustrophobia /ˌklɔːstrəˈfəʊbɪə/ 幽閉恐懼症 == Extreme or irrational fear of confined places.
Think of the way whispers travel in the circular dome of St Paul’s Cathedral in London and how the curved ceiling of the lower floor of Grand Central in New York can carry voices. Then there is the satisfying click of heels walking through an deserted hallway or the way your bathroom makes your singing sound better. This “aural architecture” can have a profound effect on the way you experience a building. (Read about how you can navigate a room using clicks alone)
	- Grand Central 大中央總站，位於美國紐約市曼哈頓中城，為大都會北方鐵路、紐約地鐵7號線、萊辛頓大道線及S線交會的地下化鐵路車站，也是美國最繁忙、最著名的鐵路車站之一。
“Aural architecture is about how we listen to buildings, the sound within buildings and how we react to them,” says Trevor Cox, an acoustic engineer at the University of Salford, in Manchester. Even though we primarily navigate our way through the world using our eyes, it seems our ears are constantly picking up information from our surroundings that unconsciously alters how we feel about a space.
	- Manchester 曼徹斯特，英國英格蘭西北區域大曼徹斯特郡的都市自治市、城市、單一管理區。「曼徹斯特」此名經常用來指整個都市區，其市區總人口在英國排名第二，僅次於倫敦。曼徹斯特以倉庫眾多聞名於世，別名「倉庫城市」
Though they emit no sound, you can hear an empty room. You can find out if it has low ceilings and where its walls are just by the way sound reflects off these surfaces. Think of the echoing noise the click of a heel makes on a marble floor as opposed to the muffled padding from someone walking on thick carpet.
	- muffle 低沈的/聽不太清的 == (of a sound) not loud because of being obstructed in some way; muted.
	- padding
		> 墊塞/填料 |Soft material such as foam or cloth used to pad or stuff something.| cushions supplied extra padding and decoration
		> 充分量的廢話 |Superfluous material in a book, speech, etc., introduced in order to make it reach a desired length.| avoid waffle or padding in your essay
“You can walk into a room blindfolded and you can probably hear if there’s a carpet on the floor without stepping on it,” says Barry Blesser, a former electrical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who coined the term aural architecture. “We can hear all kinds of things. We just don’t pay attention.”
	- blindfold
		> 遮眼布/眼罩 |A piece of cloth tied round the head to cover someone's eyes.|
		> 蒙住 |Deprive (someone) of sight by tying a piece of cloth round the head so as to cover the eyes.| he was blindfolded and trussed up in a cupboard
		> 蒙住眼睛的 |Wearing a blindfold.|
		> 蒙住眼睛的 |(of a game of chess) conducted without sight of board and pieces.|
		> 被蒙住眼睛地 |With a blindfold covering the eyes.| the reporter was driven blindfold to meet the gangster
		> 輕鬆地 |Used to convey that something is done with great ease and confidence.| he missed putts that he would normally hole blindfold
	- coin
		> 硬幣 |A flat disc or piece of metal with an official stamp, used as money.| she opened her purse and took out a coin
		> 錢幣 |Money in the form of coins.| large amounts of coin and precious metal
		> |One of the suits in some tarot packs, corresponding to pentacles in others.|
		> 鑄造 |Make (coins) by stamping metal.| guineas and half-guineas were coined
		> 鑄造 |Make (metal) into coins.| From ages past, before the time of the Bible, man has coined metal to be used as money
		> 創造/杜撰(新詞) |Invent (a new word or phrase)

We have probably all been in a building that sounds wrong. Dingy offices where noise rattles uncomfortably between the floor and the ceiling, old houses where the creaks and groans of ageing floorboards carry hauntingly from room to room, train stations where public announcements reverberate until they are indecipherable.
	- creak
		> 發出咯吱咯吱聲 |(of an object or structure, typically a wooden one) make a harsh, high-pitched sound when being moved or when pressure or weight is applied.| the stairs creaked as she went up them
		> |Show weakness or frailty under strain.| the system started to creak
		> 咯吱咯吱聲 |A harsh scraping or squeaking sound.| the creak of a floorboard broke the silence
	- aging, ageing
		> 老化 |The process of growing old.| the external signs of ageing
		> 陳化/熟化 |The process of change in the properties of a material occurring over a period, either spontaneously or through deliberate action.| the judicious use of oak ageing means the wines are capable of being confused with the great French Chardonnays
		> 老年的 |(of a person) growing old; elderly.| an ageing population
		> 使用年限將至的 |(of a thing) reaching the end of useful life.| the world's ageing fleet of oil tankers
	- floorboard
		> 地板 |A long plank making up part of a wooden floor in a building.|
		> 汽車駕駛室的車底板 |The floor of a motor vehicle.| the keys had fallen on the floorboard of her car
While it may be hard to put a finger on why, these places can feel instinctively uncomfortable to us.
Now, there is growing recognition that buildings not only need to be designed to be functional and aesthetically pleasing, but acoustically satisfying as well – leading some architects and engineers to rethink how spaces are shaped and the materials they are made from.
	- put a/one's finger on sth 確切地指出 == to discover the exact reason why a situation is the way it is, especially when something is wrong
		> There's something odd about him, but I can't quite put my finger on it.
Scientific research suggests they are wise to do so. Noisy work and home settings have been proven to annoy people, and noise annoyance itself has been linked to depression and anxiety. Furthermore, issues concentrating in the workplace due to office noise and intermittent noise has been found to significantly reduce human performance.
But the way sound interacts with a building’s physical structure can also significantly alter our moods and emotions. For instance, studies show that living in crowded housing can cause a feeling of helplessness. Rooms with loftier ceilings encourage more abstract thought as people feel more free in such airy spaces. Consider the emotional impact of a structure like the Hagia Sophia, Istanbul’s famous former cathedral and mosque, which now houses a museum. Built nearly 1,500 years ago, its domed interior and marble floors and walls can elevate human chants into ethereal sounds that seem to emanate from the depths of the ocean and create a feeling of exaltation in the listener.
	- airy
		> 通風的 |(of a room or building) spacious, well lit, and well ventilated.| the conservatory is light and airy’
		> 輕而薄的/優美的 |Delicate, as though filled with or made of air.| airy clouds
		> 優雅的 |Giving an impression of light gracefulness and elegance.| her airy presence filled the house
		> 輕浮的 |Not treating something as serious; casual.| her airy unconcern for economy

“It has a sonic aesthetic that is capable of conjuring up the divine,” says Bissera Pentcheva, an expert in Medieval art at Stanford University, who investigates the spiritual aspects of Medieval structures. “It takes human speech and chant beyond the register of human language.”
Mainstream architecture typically considers a building’s sonic voice only in the construction of concert halls, where acoustic perfection is key. The idea that you can take this a step further, and have a building itself act as a sort of musical instrument that envelops people, that’s capable of inducing feelings of tranquility, exhilaration, tension or even a trance-like state is unusual. However, it isn’t unknown.
	- tension
		> 拉緊 |The state of being stretched tight.| the parachute keeps the cable under tension as it drops
		> 繃緊 |The state of having the muscles stretched tight, especially as causing strain or discomfort.| the elimination of neck tension can relieve headaches
		> 張力 |A strained state or condition resulting from forces acting in opposition to each other.| enormous tension can build up along the margin of the two plates and occasionally explodes into immense earthquakes
		> 張力 |The degree of tightness of stitches in knitting and machine sewing.|
		> 電壓 |Electromotive force.|
		> 緊張 |Mental or emotional strain.| a mind which is affected by stress or tension cannot think as clearly
		> 緊張局勢 |A strained political or social state or relationship.| the coup followed months of tension between the military and the government
		> 取捨 |A relationship between ideas or qualities with conflicting demands or implications.| the basic tension between freedom and control
		> 使拉緊/使繃緊 |Apply a force to (something) which tends to stretch it.| it is best to insert the battens before the outhaul is tensioned
	- trance
		> 催眠狀態 |A half-conscious state characterized by an absence of response to external stimuli, typically as induced by hypnosis or entered by a medium.| she put him into a light trance
		> 恍惚/出神 |A state of abstraction.| the kind of trance he went into whenever illness was discussed
		> |A type of electronic dance music characterized by hypnotic rhythms and sounds.| in the Hades Warehouse there's the finest in trance and techno
		> 使昏睡 |Put into a trance.| she's been tranced and may need waking
When a person’s voice hits a frequency of 110Hz in the “Oracle room” of the 5,000-year-old Maltese underground temple Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum, it comes alive. It’s as if more voices join in, the sounds intensifying from every direction until it can be literally felt as a tingle through the skin. A neurological study that examined how the acoustic properties of ancient structures influenced brain function found that briefly listening to a tone of 110Hz reduced activity in the brain’s language centers and shifted activity to the brain’s emotional areas.

If the acoustics of space tuned to amplify just a single tone can affect us so profoundly, what effect might a room that amplifies many have on our consciousness? Shea Michael Trahan, an architect at Trapolin-Peer, is using cymatics – the way surfaces vibrate – and three dimensional printing technology to answer this question. He is creating 3D structures that he hopes could be scaled up so that you might be able to walk in and sing a B flat or a C major to make the building resonate, or “sing” back.
	- cymatics 細小的顆粒在振動的表面形成特定圖案的現象
“What I seek to do is to create spaces that isolate a single tone much like the Matrimandir, a golden geodesic dome used as a meditation space, focuses a single ray of light,” says Trahan. “The hyper-reverberance is actually the architectures’ gift back to the observer in that it is using their sound and extending it as much as possible to intensify or heighten the experience.”
	- Matrimandir 黃金球，來自梵文，意指「聖母殿」，係為整體瑜伽的靈修聖殿，位於南印度曙光村的中心
	- geodesic
		> |Relating to or denoting the shortest possible line between two points on a sphere or other curved surface.|
		> 曲面幾何結構的 |(of a dome or other structure) constructed from struts which follow geodesic lines and typically form an open framework of triangles and polygons.|
		> 大地測量學的 |geodetic|
		> 測地線 |A geodesic line or structure.|
There is the possibility this could have a use that goes beyond creating spaces that are enjoyable to spend time in. These sonically interactive structures could function as immersive sonic therapy rooms for existing sonic therapies for PTSD, depression and Parkinson’s disease. Vocalists could even use them to tune their voices to hit tones with precision. (Read about how hospital noise can undermine patient safety)

	- Parkinson’s disease 帕金森氏病，中樞神經系統的退行性疾病
“When space acts as an instrument, the space can tune you,” says Trahan.
Susan Magsamen, executive director of the International Arts and Mind Lab at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, is taking part in a multidisciplinary project that aims to create an entirely new type of healing space for children waking up from traumatic brain injuries. Scheduled to be built later this year, the Kennedy Krieger Children’s Hospital’s “Sensory care room” will customise sounds, such as a mother’s voice or a song, favourite smells, temperature and light to the individual child, in a room that feels like a cocoon, to help children wake up faster and better.
	- take part in 參與 == to be actively involved in something with other people:
		> All the children took part in the Thanksgiving play.
	- cocoon
		> 繭 |A silky case spun by the larvae of many insects for protection as pupae.| the moth emerged from its pale yellow papery cocoon
		> 繭狀物 |Something that envelops someone in a protective or comforting way.| a cocoon of bedclothes
		> 防護膜 |A covering that prevents the corrosion of metal equipment.|
		> 把……緊緊包住 |Envelop in a protective or comforting way.| we felt cold even though we were cocooned in our sleeping bags
		> 使自己孤立 |Retreat from the stressful conditions of public life into the cosy private world of the family.| Americans are spending more time cocooning at home

Michael Fowler, a member of the audio communication group at the Technical University of Berlin, approaches aural architecture differently. He is inspired by open spaces that have unique sonic features, such as such as Japanese gardens that feature dry stone waterfalls that tinkle like real waterfalls, by clever positioning of water features out of sight. He studies what he calls “exemplary” sound spaces in an attempt to find out what makes them special, be it geometric forms or the arrangement of materials in a room. He wants to use this to create an algorithm or a computational routine, a sort of digital aural archetype, which architects can use when designing buildings or other public spaces.
	- tinkle
		> 發叮噹聲 |Make or cause to make a light, clear ringing sound.| cool water tinkled in the stone fountains
		> 叮噹聲 |A light, clear ringing sound.| the distant tinkle of a cow bell
“Using this, you can produce this type of exemplary space, and they may exist in very different media, but their actual structure, the relationship between sound and space, will be common between all of them,” says Fowler. “Though when you abstract them out, they may look completely different.”

Buildings, however, don’t exist in isolation. They form towns and cities where there is no escaping the roar of traffic, the boom of construction work, blaring nightclubs and the piercing wail of sirens and alarms. Around 83 million people in Europe live in areas where sound pressure levels are above recommended levels, says Fowler.
	- blare
		> 發出響而刺耳的聲音 |Make or cause to make a loud, harsh sound.| the ambulance arrived outside, siren blaring
		> 響而刺耳的聲音 |A loud, harsh sound.| a blare of trumpets
	- siren
		> 汽笛/警報器  |A device that makes a loud prolonged signal or warning sound.|
		> 塞壬 |Each of a number of women or winged creatures whose singing lured unwary sailors on to rocks.|
		> 妖婦 |A woman who is considered to be alluring or fascinating but also dangerous in some way.|
		> 鰻螈 |An eel-like American amphibian with tiny forelimbs, no hindlimbs, small eyes, and external gills, typically living in muddy pools.|
New technologies and new types of materials could help. Augmenting existing structures with vibrating façades, for instance, could potentially cancel out noise by exploiting the physics of interference. Produce a sound wave at the right frequency and wavelength, and it will counteract the sound waves of an unwanted noise.
“In the future it may be possible that if you lived near an airport, as soon as you stepped within a couple of metres near the building, the sound of the airport disappears because of the active noise cancellation from the whole building,” says Fowler.
But if it’s not possible to get rid of the noise, why not embrace it? Make traffic noise musical, for instance. In 2016, Jordan Lacey, a research fellow at RMIT University, Melbourne, created a noise transformation installation that picked up the traffic noise adjacent to a park via microphones, mixed it with musical sounds and played them back through loudspeakers in the park area. It had people living in nearby housing, wanting to sit on their balconies, instead of shutting themselves off from the outside.
The conceptual MIX house, designed by Karen Van Lengen, an architect at the University of Virginia and her colleagues, envisages concave windows which act as “sonic dishes” that can be angled in different directions to capture sounds from the surrounding neighborhood. Homeowners can then mix these sounds through an audio system to create musical compositions where a dog barking or a child shouting becomes an ambient soundtrack.
	- envisage
		> 想像/設想 |Contemplate or conceive of as a possibility or a desirable future event.| the Rome Treaty envisaged free movement across frontiers
		> 想像 |Form a mental picture of (something not yet existing or known)| he knew what he liked but had difficulty envisaging it
But while it’s one thing to invite the noises of our surroundings into our homes in new ways, is it possible to escape them altogether? Architects tasked with designing future cities are more aware now of the need for quiet and nature sounds in city soundscapes. After all, we didn’t evolve listening to the hum of air conditioners or screeching tires. Lacey believes it’s important to have aural architecture installations nested throughout cities to create a network of “sonic ruptures” – places where existing urban noises are transformed with the use of technologies and landscaping to create unique soundscapes that are aimed at enriching people's experience of an area.

		> 使不和 |Breach or disturb (a harmonious feeling or situation)| once trust and confidence has been ruptured it can be difficult to regain
		> 不和 |A breach of a harmonious relationship.| the rupture with his father would never be healed
“It’s all very well to complain about the noise of the city and say it has to be more like nature but what about all the people who don’t have access to that?” says Lacey. “We can design these sonic environments to give people not the experience of nature because it isn’t nature but some sort of urban equivalent. Think about how big some of these cities are going to be in 50 years time.”
Thanks to virtual reality systems, architects are beginning to listen to how the spaces they design might sound like through “auralisations” of structures using acoustic modeling software like Odeon. Such auralisations are used to prevent sound transfer between spaces and make design decisions such where to place absorption, diffusion or reflective surfaces.
	- auralisation, auralization 可聽化，是一種程序，旨在模擬和模擬在虛擬空間中作為聲場呈現的聲學現象的體驗
“Architects are able to hear what their designs sound like and where required, adapt them to improve the acoustic response,” says Naomi Tansey, an acoustics consultant at the engineering firm Arup. Going further, auralisations enable the creation of unique spaces, such as the central auditorium in the Elbphilharmonie concert hall at Hamburg which sports a stunning algorithm-designed “skin” made of 10,000 gypsum fibre acoustic panels, which help create a balanced reverberation.

Others such as University of York’s Mariana Lopez study acoustic heritage with the aid of software. “Auralisations are used to allow us to listen to spaces that either no longer exist or have changed throughout history,” says Lopez. Aside from preserving acoustic history, these auralisations are important when restoring historic structures as the materials used can affect the acoustics significantly.
But it could still be some time before our homes, offices and cities become pleasing to the ear as much as they are to the eye.
“Very little in the language of bureaucracy or policy says that we need to design for this,” says Lacey. “We design to minimum benchmarks.”
	- bureaucracy
		> 官僚政治 |A system of government in which most of the important decisions are taken by state officials rather than by elected representatives.|

		> 用標準衡量 |Evaluate (something) by comparison with a standard.| we are benchmarking our performance against external criteria
		> 給出結果 |Give particular results during a benchmark test.| the device should benchmark at between 100 and 150 MHz
If we could start to see sounds like Fowler, who views them as a clay-like material, a thing to be shaped, formed and composed, it could open up truly exciting possibilities in the way we construct our acoustic environments. "If you were knowledgeable about sounds, how it was linked to space and how to change its behaviors,” says Fowler, it could expand our experience of the built environment around us.
