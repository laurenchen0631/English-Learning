See the world’s oldest trees by starlight
BY CATHERINE ZUCKERMAN

In one giant sequoia’s lifetime multiple generations of humans will be born and die. These enormous trees, native to California, can live for thousands of years. Though that time frame is considerable, writes photographer Beth Moon in her book, Ancient Skies, Ancient Trees, “compared to the age of the stars above, it is not even a blink of an eye.”
    > sequoia == either of two huge coniferous California trees of the bald cypress family that may reach a height of over 300 feet
        >> conifer 針葉樹 == A tree that bears cones and needle-like or scale-like leaves that are typically evergreen.  
        >> bald
            >>> |Having a scalp wholly or partly lacking hair| he was starting to go bald.
            >>> |Not having any extra detail or explanation; plain or blunt.| the bald statement in the preceding paragraph requires amplification
        >> cypress 柏 == An evergreen coniferous tree with small rounded woody cones and flattened shoots bearing small scale-like leaves.

        == photographer Beth Moon writes “compared to the age of the stars above, it is not even a blink of an eye.” in her book, Ancient Skies, Ancient Trees.

A self-taught photographer with a fine art background, Moon has been photographing trees for 20 years. She spent much of that time shooting on film and then processing her images using a 19th-century black-and-white method called platinum palladium printing. For more than a decade she photographed trees all over the world from sunrise to sunset.

    > platinum palladium printing 鉑鈀印相
        > platinum == a heavy, grayish-white, highly malleable and ductile metallic element, resistant to most chemicals. Symbol : Pt
        > palladium == a rare metallic element of the platinum group, silver-white, ductile and malleable, harder and fusing more readily than platinum. Symbol : Pd
    > all over == everywhere in a particular place

But then Moon came across a scientific study that suggests a correlation between tree growth and galactic cosmic radiation. “As I thought about it,” she says, “it made so much sense; you know the sun is a star anyway - so why wouldn’t there be this very strong correlation with starlight at night as well as our sun during the day?”
    > come across == to find something by chance

The idea for her project, Diamond Nights, was born. Over the next three and a half years Moon traveled around the United States and also to several other countries, including England, Italy, Namibia, and Botswana, documenting ancient baobabs, junipers, sequoias, and more under skies blanketed in stars. Her mission was simple: Find out where the world’s darkest places overlap with the world’s oldest trees, go there, and make beautiful photographs. 
    > baobab 猴麵包樹 == A short tree with a very thick trunk and large edible fruit, living to a great age.
    > juniper 杜松 == An evergreen shrub or small tree that bears berrylike cones, widely distributed throughout Eurasia and North America.
        >> shrub 灌木 == A woody plant which is smaller than a tree and has several main stems arising at or near the ground.
        >> Eurasia 歐亞大陸 
    > blanket
        > |Cover completely with a thick layer of something.| the countryside was blanketed in snow
        > |Stifle or keep quiet| the double glazing blankets the noise a bit

Execution of this plan, of course, was not quite as simple.
First of all, Moon says, lots of places have either old trees or dark skies, but not both. When the two do intersect, the location is often challenging to reach. So Moon hired local guides to help her seek out her woody subjects, which were sometimes in extremely remote areas. “We would travel all day long never seeing another person, a sign, or even any roads,” she says. On these occasions Moon would camp under the tree, eating canned sardines for sustenance and patiently waiting for clouds to drift in and out of her frame.
    > first of all
    > sardine 沙丁魚 == A young pilchard or other young or small herring-like fish.
    > sustenance == Food and drink regarded as a source of strength; nourishment.

For Diamond Nights, Moon made the transition from film photography to digital capture. It’s a more light-sensitive technique, she says, and results in incredibly vivid images. Planning all her shoots around moonless nights, she wanted each tree to be primarily bathed in starlight, with additional glow from flashlights, for example, as necessary.
    > vivid
        >> |Producing powerful feelings or strong, clear images in the mind.| memories of that evening were still vivid
        >> |(of a colour) intensely deep or bright.| the rhododendron bush provides a vivid splash of mauve

Because of the dark conditions, Moon set her camera on a slow shutter speed. This meant standing by for wind, and pausing during gusts. “With a 30-second exposure you don’t want the branches shaking,” she says. “So there was a lot of downtime.”
    > gust == A sudden strong rush of wind.
    > downtime == Time during which a machine, especially a computer, is out of action or unavailable for use.

Though Moon is not a scientist, she has become interested in the scientific aspect of trees as well as light pollution. Some of the “wildest” places she sought out, she says, were actually spoiled by artificial light coming from nearby buildings and towns. “It has been said that mankind’s destiny is written in the stars,” she writes in her book, “but it will be a very bleak destiny” if we eventually can no longer see them.
