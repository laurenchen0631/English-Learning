When I first told people back in 2016 that I was getting my first tattoo, the most common response I got from those who were already inked themselves was, “You’re going to get addicted to getting tattoos.” I found this notion a little ridiculous — I was nervous enough just getting a small one on my ankle. I couldn’t imagine getting hooked on something that was not only expensive, but painful and permanent.
Fast forward to 2019, and I’ve since gotten two more tattoos, each one progressively larger and more detailed, and I’m already planning my fourth, fifth, sixth, etc. As I was warned, I have indeed gotten hooked. For me, it's both because I love how it makes me feel about my body, and because I've gotten to discover a new form of expression in my mid-30s.
According to a 2018 report from Statista, roughly 46 percent of Americans have at least one tattoo, and 30 percent of these people have two or three — 19 percent have up to four or five. Clearly, other people love getting inked just as much as I do. But while tattoos can be fun to have, are they actually addictive?
Not in the way you probably think. “The word addiction in the context of tattoos is misused,” says Dr. Daniel Selling, a psychologist at Williamsburg Therapy Group in New York. In order for a person's behavior to be deemed an addiction, it needs to meet a specific criteria: salience (the addiction becoming the most important thing in a person’s life), mood modification (the euphoric feelings that accompany the activity that they engage in), tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, conflict, and relapse, adds Dr. Mark Griffiths, a professor of behavioral addiction at the UK's Nottingham Trent University.
	- deem 認為 == Regard or consider in a specified way.
	- salience /ˈseɪlɪəns/  突出/特點 == The quality of being particularly noticeable or important; prominence.
Tattooing, explains Dr. Griffiths, does not meet this criteria — and while any behavior can become impulsive, addiction also “relies on constant rewards or reinforcement." Alcoholics, gamblers, or drug users, for instance, might be able to feed their habits with frequent rewards, but even the most heavily tattooed people can't be constantly getting inked.
Based on the criteria and the infrequency of rewards, Dr. Griffiths concludes, "I would argue that it would be very hard to be addicted to getting tattoos."
Still, while you can’t have a tattoo addiction, per se, it can be a dependence where you feel some elements of need and withdrawal, according to Addiction Center, and perhaps spend too much time or money getting work done. If repeated tattooing is causing problems related to your finances, work, relationships, emotional well-being and/or physical health, San Francisco-based therapist Marc Wallis, suggests seeking professional help.
For many people who love tattoos, though, the passion doesn't interfere with their lives; rather, it enhances them. No one knows this better than renowned Los Angeles-based tattoo artist Lisa Orth, who has somewhere in the ballpark of 100 tattoos herself. “It’s an incredible feeling to be able to permanently customize yourself with artwork," she explains.
	- ballpark
		> 棒球場 |A baseball ground.|
		> 預估範圍 |An area or range within which an amount or estimate is likely to be correct.| we can make a pretty good guess that this figure's in the ballpark
		> 大約的 |(of a price or cost) approximate.| the ballpark figure is $400–500
That feeling of self-expression, she adds, can be an empowering experience — and it's one of the main reasons she sees clients come back again and again. Tattooing can be a way of engaging with, and taking possession of, one’s body in an active way, Orth explains. She says it can allow people to define themselves visually in a way that forces the observer to see a person as they most authentically see themselves.
	- engage with 與..有所牽連 == to become involved with (someone or something)
That’s a big draw (so to speak) for those who repeatedly get inked. In addition to the satisfaction a person can get from such a personal art form, Dr. Selling notes that being tattooed can also lead to an adrenaline rush of sorts. “It’s the body tolerating annoyance and pain coupled with excitement and change," he explains.
	- big draw 非常吸引人的點 == a big source of attraction.
	- so to speak 可以這麼說 == used to explain that what you are saying is not to be understood exactly as stated
		> In that relationship it's very much Lorna who wears the trousers, so to speak
	- couple
		> 對/雙 |Two people or things of the same sort considered together.| a couple of girls were playing marbles
		> 一對舞伴 |A pair of partners in a dance or game.|
		> 夫婦/未婚夫妻 |Two people who are married or otherwise closely associated romantically or sexually.|
		> 幾個/一點點 |An indefinite small number.| he hoped she'd be better in a couple of days
		> 結合 |Link or combine (something) with something else.| a sense of hope is coupled with a palpable sense of loss
		> 連接 |Connect (a railway vehicle or a piece of equipment) to another.| a cable is coupled up to one of the wheels
		> 連接 |Connect (two electrical components) using electromagnetic induction, electrostatic charge, or an optical link.|
		> 與..有性關係 |Mate or have sexual intercourse.| as middle-class youth grew more tolerant of sex, they started to couple more often
It's important to note, however, that that enjoying a rush is different than participating in self-harm. Since tattooing is a needle penetrating skin, that can potentially feed someone's desire to feel pain or change their appearance due to unhappiness with themselves. As explained by Dr. Tracy Alderman in Psychology Today, “Once in a while there will be cases in which piercing and/or tattoos do fit the definition of self-injury."
	- (every) once in a while 偶爾 == every so often == sometimes, but not regularly
		> You meet some really interesting people every once in a while.
		> We see each other every once in a while.
"But overwhelmingly," Dr. Alderman added, "self-injury is a distinct behavior, in definition, method and purpose, from tattooing and piercing.”
Besides the allure of the pain and pleasure of getting tattoos, some people enjoy doing it because it makes them feel like they're part of a larger culture. The images or words scrawled on their bodies might allow them to both fit into a group and stand out from others. Wallis notes that others, however, may view tattoos as a way to assert control over their bodies (particularly after cases of trauma or abuse, or in situations involving self-harm). A tattoo being used “to register a traumatic event is a powerful re-doing," wrote Dr. Suzanne Phillips in a PsychCentral post. "It starts at the body’s barrier of protection, the skin, and uses it as a canvas to bear witness, express, release and unlock the viscerally felt impact of trauma.”
	- scrawl /skrɔːl/ 
		> 潦草地寫 |Write (something) in a hurried, careless way.| Charlie scrawled his signature
		> 潦草的筆跡 |An example of hurried, careless writing.| the page was covered in scrawls and doodles
	- redo
		> 再做 |Do (something) again or differently.| a whole day's work has to be redone
		> 改裝 |Redecorate (a room or building)| the house is being redone exactly to suit his taste
		> 改裝 |A redecoration of a room or building.| a total redo of the second floor shopping concourse
	- visceral /ˈvɪs(ə)r(ə)l/ 
		> 內臟的 |Relating to the viscera.| the visceral nervous system
		> 出自內心深處的 |Relating to deep inward feelings rather than to the intellect.| the voters' visceral fear of change
But no matter what your reason(s) for getting multiple pieces done may be, the fact that it's always a unique experience is perhaps the biggest pull of all. Right now, I'm planning my next tattoo to be a blue whale on my thigh, a sentimental piece that will also make me feel mighty and fearless. After all, I've gone from being someone scared of getting my first tiny tattoo to someone who actively looks forward to making her body a whole new temple.

As Orth aptly puts it: “Getting tattooed is one of the remaining rituals in our culture that are physical, mental and emotional challenges, where you come out transformed on the other side.”
