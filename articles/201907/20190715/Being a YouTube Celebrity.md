Emma Chamberlain, 18, is the funniest person on YouTube. What does she do? So far the content of her videos has not been the point: She makes cupcakes, or tries her hand at sewing. Like Phoebe Waller-Bridge of “Fleabag,” an artist close to twice her age, she interrupts the proceedings constantly to speak to her audience. That’s where her videos actually happen.
	- backbreaking, back-breaking 極費氣力的/累人的 == (of manual labour) physically demanding.
	- sew -> sewed -> sewn
		> 縫合/縫補 |Join, fasten, or repair (something) by making stitches with a needle and thread or a sewing machine.| she sewed the seams and hemmed the border
		> 縫上 |Attach (something) to something else by sewing.| she could sew the veil on properly in the morning
		> 縫製 |Make (a garment) by sewing.| the two sisters sewed their own dresses
Watch a video from 2018 called “MY BIRTHDAY IS RUINED.” It has no introduction, just Chamberlain, talking, pointing to the recipe pages she has taped to a cabinet. “Can you believe I literally printed out the recipe, like we’re in literally like the Middle Ages, using a printer?” she says. She claps her hands, apparently hurting herself. The video freezes and text appears: “clapped too hard :/”
	- tape
		> 膠布 |A narrow strip of material, typically used to hold or fasten something.| a reel of tape

Chamberlain was born in San Bruno, Calif., on May 22, 2001. An only child, her parents divorced when she was 5. She began watching YouTube when she was 6 “to connect with other people and see what they were up to,” she said. “And weirdly enough, it felt like I had friends that were cool, and it was people that I maybe admired.”
Growing up now means that you watch a lot of videos, and make them as well. Chamberlain filmed videos for school — in religion and math classes, videos were required — and for fun.
During her sophomore year of high school, a few of Chamberlain’s friends began combing SoundCloud for trap rap remixes of Christmas music. They would find the funniest song they could and make up a jokey dance routine for it and film it. Chamberlain would edit videos during fourth period and post them on a private Instagram.
Her instinctual editing style involved zooming, adding text to the screen and pausing to point out the best parts. “I felt like that made my friends and I laugh a lot more when I was emphasizing these things,” she said. “Rather than us just having to catch it while watching and then it doesn’t really land as much because most people aren’t going to notice the funny little things that I would notice.”
One of the early videos Chamberlain posted on her private friends-and-family Instagram — her finsta — was her reaction to a take-home chemistry test. She was one of the younger students in a very rigorous class. They were assigned an online test. Chamberlain spent three hours on it, but when she pressed submit, the website glitched and her completed test was lost. She found out later that everybody else in her class had found an answer key online.
	- finsta == Fake Instagram ==  A spam Instagram account where people post what they are too afraid to post on the real account
She started filming herself right when she learned that the test had been deleted. She was sobbing. She said it was one of the worst moments of her life. She reacted by turning a camera on.
“When something’s really significant, whether it’s good, bad, ugly, I like being able to look back at a moment in time that was high-emotion,” she said. “Whenever I’m crying I like, weirdly, to document it. Every time I cry I always take one photo of myself afterwards because I like to look back and think ‘Remember when I was so upset about X, Y and Z? Look at me now — I don’t care about that anymore!’”
Chamberlain stopped enjoying high school toward the end of her sophomore year in 2017. She had been working unceasingly, with college in mind. Socially, she said, her values didn’t align with some students at her school, who seemed to take things for granted. “Not only things like money, but also, like, morals,” she said.
	- with sth in mind 對..有所計畫 == to have a plan or intention
		> Did you have anything in mind for Helen's present?
	- take sth for granted 把..視為理所當然 == to never think about something because you believe it will always be available or stay exactly the same
		> I took it for granted that I would find the perfect job.
		> It’s easy to take your parents for granted.
Her father, Michael John Chamberlain, drove out to the San Francisco Bay for a talk. They talked for an hour and, he said that he told her, “I was like basically, you know what, you’ve got to find something outside of school that you’re excited about.”
“Less than a week later, she was like, ‘I want to start a YouTube channel,’” he said.

It’s been two years. Chamberlain now has 8 million YouTube followers. She brought in the editing tricks that first set her friends and family rolling on the floor, but now they take longer to perfect.

Chamberlain edits each video she makes for between 20 and 30 hours, often at stretches of 10 or 15 hours at a time. Her goal is to be funny, to keep people watching. It’s as if the comic value of each video is inversely proportional to how little humor she experiences while making it. During her marathon editing sessions, she said, she laughs for “maybe, maybe 10 seconds max.”
	+ stretch
“It’s almost like when you’re doing your homework, you’re halfway through a math work sheet, you’re really in it right there. You can’t hear anything, you can’t see anything,” she said. “Or if you’re watching a movie and you’re so zoned in you don’t even remember what real life is. You just think you’re in the movie. That’s exactly how it is, but times five. I’m so zoned in. I have this weird mind-set where it’s me quickly analyzing every five seconds, ‘Is this boring, is this stupid, can I cut this? Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes. No.’”
	- zoned in 專注的 == focused
		> if you’re watching a movie and you’re so zoned in you don’t even remember what real life is
Like other professional social media users, the work has taken a physical toll on her. (She releases roughly one video a week.) She used to edit at a desktop, but she developed back pain. Now she works from her bed. She keeps blue mood lighting on, but her vision has deteriorated. She wears reading glasses “like I’m 85 years old, because my eyes do actually get really strained.”
	- take a toll 造成痛苦、傷亡或破壞 == If something takes its/a toll, it causes suffering, deaths, or damage.
		> The problems of the past few months have taken their toll on her health and there are shadows under her eyes.
		> The deepening recession has also taken its toll in the south of the country, where unemployment is rife.
		> Like other professional social media users, the work has taken a physical toll on her. 
She’s training herself for long-distance editing. “I’ve actually gotten to a point now where I feel like I’m really, really mentally strong and I don’t really lose my marbles as often,” she said.
	- lose my marble 發瘋 == The act or process of going crazy, usually caused by life stressors
		> I am losing my marbles staying locked up in this jail cell.
In May of 2020, she will turn 19.

Over these two years, Chamberlain invented the way people talk on YouTube now, particularly the way they communicate authenticity. Her editing tricks and her mannerisms are ubiquitous. There is an entire subgenre of videos that mimic her style, and a host of YouTubers who talk, or edit, just like her. The Atlantic recently noted this and declared she is “the most important YouTuber” working today.
	- authenticity 真偽/真實性/可靠性 == The quality of being authentic.
	- mannerism
		> 習性 |A habitual gesture or way of speaking or behaving.| learning the great man's speeches and studying his mannerisms
		> 癖性 |An ordinary gesture or expression that becomes abnormal through exaggeration or repetition.|
		> 格調/形式 |Excessive use of a distinctive style in art, literature, or music.| he seemed deliberately to be stripping his art of mannerism
		> 風格主義 |Mannerism|
“It messed with my head a little bit when people started to imitate what I was doing,” Chamberlain said. “Although I was flattered, absolutely flattered. And also, the way I film and edit, it’s really fun and so I’m glad that other people have found inspiration in that and have taken that and done what they can with it. I think that that’s great. But at times it can be kind of uninspiring and that’s no one’s fault but my own.”
When someone introduces a new vocabulary to a medium, they don’t have much say in who uses it and who doesn’t.
	- have a say 有發言權 == To have an active and participatory role in making or influencing a decision about something.
“I always fed off the fact that I was in uncharted territory and I liked that,” she said. “And then it got to a point where I wasn’t in uncharted territory anymore and people were calling me unoriginal. Which was a huge blow to me in my head! Because I was like, I created this kind of style that was super cool to me and super exciting for me, and now that other people are doing it, now all of a sudden I’m unoriginal, which is something that I’ve always really tried to be. That’s what makes me feel good creatively. So when people started to say that, I kind of had a full, you know, not like mental breakdown, but we could also say that. Not a mental breakdown! But I definitely freaked out.”
	- feed off/on sth 因..而增加 == to increase because of something, or to use something to succeed or get advantages
		> Fascism feeds off poverty.
	- freak out 嚇到 == to become or cause someone to become extremely emotional
		> He freaked out when he heard he'd got the job.
		> This song just freaks me out whenever I hear it.

“I didn’t honestly have any perspective on YouTube or the popular YouTubers until I took her to Playlist Live and I was like, ‘Holy crap,’” said Sophia Pinetree Chamberlain, Emma’s mother, of attending the 2018 convention of YouTubers. “My life is never going to be the same. This is crazy. Because I didn’t know how popular she was. I would just go to the little Marriott store to get a little cold brew coffee and fans were wanting to take pictures with me, and I was like, ‘How do you even know who I am?’”
	- cold brew coffee 冷萃咖啡
Chamberlain’s parents have supported her unconventional choices, like dropping out of school in the beginning of her junior year and moving to Los Angeles to live by herself while still a teenager. She says that they were and are her best friends.
Both of them worry about her working too hard.
“I just want her to be healthy and happy,” her father said. “Her mom and I are not dance parents. My feeling is, and I tell her this often, you can walk away from this at any time. If it’s not good for you and it’s not healthy for you, it’s not worth it.”

In June 2018, Chamberlain left the Bay Area to live alone in L.A. and fully immerse herself in YouTubeland.
Professional YouTubers are the children of reality television. The dramas of their videos are often inextricable from their lives. When Jake Paul and Tana Mongeau, two famous YouTubers, said they were engaged last month, it was impossible for fans to parse whether they were telling the truth. It barely mattered. This is what celebrities are now, when they’re not the dinosaurs left over from what used to be called the monoculture.
	- inextricable /ɪnˈɛkstrɪkəb(ə)l/
		> 分不開的 |impossible to disentangle or separate.| the past and the present are inextricable
		> 無法擺脫的/無法逃離的 |Impossible to escape from.| an inextricable situation
	- parse
		> 從語法上分析 |Resolve (a sentence) into its component parts and describe their syntactic roles.| I asked a couple of students to parse these sentences for me
		> |Analyse (a string or text) into logical syntactic components.| a user question input is parsed into an internal conceptual representation
		> |An act of parsing a string or a text.| a failed parse was retried
	- monoculture 單一種植 == The cultivation of a single crop in a given area.
YouTubers tend to bond and/or feud with one another constantly, because this is social media as much as it is performance art. They recreate the overheated dynamics of the high school environment that Chamberlain wanted to escape.
“It’s weird because I left high school to get out of that B.S. and now here we are in L.A., where it’s almost worse,” she said.
	- feud
		> 夙怨/長期爭鬥 |A prolonged and bitter quarrel or dispute.| his long-standing feud with Universal Pictures
		> 世仇 |A state of prolonged mutual hostility, typically between two families or communities, characterized by murderous assaults in revenge for previous injuries.| a savage feud over drugs money
		> 長期鬥爭 |Be engaged in a prolonged and bitter quarrel or dispute.| Hoover feuded with the CIA for decades
	- overheated
		> 過熱的 |Having become or been made too hot.| let the overheated engine cool off
		> 太激烈的/太強烈的 |Too excited or agitated.| Things got a little overheated at the meeting.
		> 經濟膨脹的 |Showing marked economic inflation.| the overheated market for homes
	- B.S. == Bullshit
Viewers try to enact drama on her. They speculate about which YouTuber she’s dating, or which friends she’s on the outs with. They worry about or criticize how she looks. Some declare her fake, because she’s been doing content with advertisers.
	- on the outs 與..不合 == in a state of disagreement or unfriendliness
		> Dick is on the outs with his father.

“It breaks me to bits when I see the backlash because her hair and makeup is this way or that way,” her mother said. “That’s what worries me. It makes her sad and hurts her feelings like any human being. Now it’s not just two girls in high school, we’re talking thousands of people on social media.”
It also differs from high school in socially advantageous ways. For one thing, now she has the ability to remove herself, respectfully, from situations, or friendships, that are dramatic or unpleasant.
	- remove oneself 離去 == escape == flee
“If somebody has a bad reputation on the internet or if they have a really good reputation on the internet, I don’t care. I want to meet said person and make up my mind for myself, and then go from there,” she said.
	- make up my mind 下決心 == to decide
		> I haven't made up my mind where to go yet.
		> She made up her mind to call him again.
	+ said 上述的 == Used in legal language or humorously to refer to someone or something already mentioned or named.
		> acting in pursuance of the said agreement

Chamberlain also makes good money. SocialBlade, a social media analytics firm, estimates that from her videos alone she makes at least $120,000 a year, and perhaps as much as $2 million. Sponsor deals with Hollister and Louis Vuitton are another revenue stream.
	- Hollister 霍利斯特，是美國Abercrombie & Fitch旗下的自有品牌。該品牌主要消費客層為14至18歲，相較於母品牌A&F，該品牌走的是相較平價的路線
	- Louis Vuitton 通常縮寫為LV, 是法國的一個時尚品牌。由路易·威登於1854年在巴黎創立
Chamberlain’s most popular videos tend to be collaborations, which tap the strength of multiple audiences like any crossover event. She has appeared several times with Ethan and Grayson Dolan, two well-known YouTuber twins. Gossip has followed.
	- crossover
		> 天橋/平交道 |A point or place of crossing from one side to the other.|
		> 成名 |The process of achieving success in a different field or style, especially in popular music.|
		> 交叉 |Relating to or denoting trials of medical treatment in which experimental subjects and control groups are exchanged after a set period.| a crossover study
		> 
	- crossover event 穿越/跨界

In one video from June, Chamberlain and the Dolans pretended to be studying for high school finals, playing with the stereotype of YouTubers as stupid slackers and praising students who might be studying for real.
	- slacker 偷懶的人 == a person who does not work hard enough
“For me personally, I just don’t have anything to prove anymore,” she said. “I know exactly who I am, I know that I’m intelligent and acting dumb or acting like whatever. If that’s funny to me because I know it’s false then so be it.”

Chamberlain has now decided upon a new approach. “I’m just going to not stick to one thing so strictly,” she said.
	- decided upon
Her recent videos are less jittery, less edited. She has been trying to let her narrative and her scripts speak, with fewer interruptions than before.
	- jittery
Recently, she has tried anthologies and also stunts, like spending 24 hours on the balcony of her house. She thinks those videos have been different, and that she has, to some degree, broken out of the box she made for herself.
	+ stunt
		> 妨礙生長 |Prevent from growing or developing properly.| some weeds produce chemicals that stunt the plant's growth
		> 驚人的表演/驚險動作 |An action displaying spectacular skill and daring.| the stunt involved jumping out of a hot-air balloon while attached to a piece of elastic
		> 表演特技 |Perform stunts, especially aerobatics.| 
		> 引人注目的花招/噱頭 |Something unusual done to attract attention.|  the story was spread as a publicity stunt to help sell books
The balcony stunt, for instance, she said, was one of the more emotionally challenging things she had ever done for video. She said that the more she puts into what she makes, the less she has to do to make the video work in the edit.
“I’m trying to make the stuff that I’m filming more dynamic so that when I’m editing there’s less pressure on me to kind of create something that’s not there,” she said. “I’m starting to realize that editing is very personal, and 90 percent of the editing is just so that I’m not bored. So I don’t have to overdo it. I’m trying to find that balance right now, so that I don’t overwork myself.”
	+ so that 為了 == in order that
