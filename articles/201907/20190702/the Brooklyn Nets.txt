Kevin Durant and the Sudden Arrival of the Brooklyn Nets
Nathaniel Friedman on KD teaming up with Kyrie Irving and the illusion of building a team the Right Way.
BY NATHANIEL FRIEDMAN | July 1, 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When all dies, all shall be reborn, and from the throes of destruction, a new world shall be birthed, which is why the meek and wretched look forward to and the very powerful dread just such a cataclysm, and why Free Agency 2020 was so hotly anticipated.

Although it now seems like a thousand years ago, owing to both yesterday’s ravages and the morbid way the postseason unfolded, the league was once thought to revolve around, and be at the mercy of, the Warriors, and only this offseason  —  when they would presumably lose Kevin Durant — could bring about something that resembled a state of parity (which has never been the way the top-heavy NBA works, by the way) and rejuvenate the sport.
	- ravage

All that changed on Sunday when the news broke that Durant, along with Kyrie Irving, the Marianne Williamson of the NBA, was headed to Brooklyn. In the blink of an eye, the league split wide open, and the Warriors went from the center of the universe to just another team. It was the end of an era and the dawning of a new one, and while it’s just the beginning for a Nets team that’s staring down legitimacy for the first time in nearly 20 years (no one believes it today, but they made the Finals in 2002), landing Durant and Irving felt like a happy ending for the franchise. It’s a stretch to say that we were all pulling for the Nets. But that franchise, and whoever its fans are, have suffered enough over the years, and unless you’re a sadist, there’s little joy in watching a franchise flounder for decades. Watching the Nets claw their way back from the depths of despair has been heartening because, rather than resorting to gimmickry or galaxy-brained tinkering, general manager Sean Marks has built up a quality team one step at a time.

	- one step at a time 一步步地 == slowly and carefully, doing just a little at a time
		> He wanted to rush through the job, but I encouraged him to take it one step at a time.
There’s a logic there that’s innately satisfying, because it makes us feel like the world makes sense, as well as the possibility that a good-faith effort can, and is perhaps more likely to, pay off in the end. It’s also vindication for bozos who have spent the last few seasons waiting for the 76ers to get their metaphysical comeuppance for “cheating” via The Process, gleefully danced on the Rockets’ grave, or who have done entirely too much hand-wringing over whether the Warriors “deserved” their titles (again with the accusations of “cheating,” as if that meant something more than just breaking a written rule); whether signing Durant was bad karma; and, if you’re especially tacky, if their ill-fated 2019 postseason was some sort of payback. This brand of NBA theology, which in its silliest manifestation bows down to the “Basketball Gods,” is rarely about mysteries and miracles and almost always about moralizing, i.e. an excuse to punish those who run afoul of intrinsically conservative views about how players, and athletes in general, should act. There’s not much daylight between tweeting “KD a bitch” twice a day and wishing the NBA were more like college ball, insofar as both want sports to enforce a sense of right and wrong, often as compensation for an anxiety about these categories falling to pieces out in the real world.
	- bozo 傢伙/笨蛋 == A stupid or insignificant man.
	- comeuppance 報應 == A punishment or fate that someone deserves.

		> After leaving home he fell afoul of the law.
	- insofar as == in so far as 到…的程度 == to the extent that == to the degree that
	- fall/go to pieces
		> 崩潰 |If someone goes/falls to pieces, that person becomes unable to think clearly and control their emotions because of something unpleasant or difficult that they have experienced| She just went (all) to pieces during finals.
		> 失敗 |If a relationship, organization, or system goes/falls to pieces, it fails:|
The idea that there is a Right Way to do things in the NBA may no longer be an explicit, and implicitly racialized, fault line in the same way that it was in the 2000s. No one is using this trope to advance an agenda, and for all the debates around “cheating,” there’s very little discussion about the other side of the coin that would be lauded as the alternative, perhaps because outside of the Nets, the best example of doing things the Right Way is the pre-Durant Warriors. Even Marks’s textbook rebuild, which is as close as anyone’s come to emulating the Spurs’ model (always hire ex-Spurs!), has earned near-universal respect, and a nascent place in our hearts, without being posited as the antidote to the rash of “cheating.” It’s almost like this new incarnation of the Right Way would prefer to harp on the negative rather than risk its standing by advocating for anything positive, which is kind of the way shitty, self-serving categories function and why they persist.
	- fault line
		> 斷層線 |a fault (= a break in the earth's surface)|
		> 問題/隱憂 |a problem that may not be obvious and could cause something to fail| The fault lines of imperfect peace deals are already showing.

		> 轉義/比喻 |A figurative or metaphorical use of a word or expression.| ‘my sense that philosophy has become barren is a recurrent trope of modern philosophy
		> 主題 |A significant or recurrent theme; a motif.| she uses the Eucharist as a pictorial trope
	- nascent 新興的 == (especially of a process or organization) just coming into existence and beginning to display signs of future potential.
	- harp
		> 豎琴 |A musical instrument consisting of a frame supporting a graduated series of parallel strings, played by plucking with the fingers. The modern orchestral harp has an upright frame, with pedals which enable the strings to be retuned to different keys.|
		> 口琴 |harmonica|
		> 豎琴螺 |harp shell; harp snail|
	- harp on 反覆訴說/嘮叨 == Talk or write persistently and tediously on (a particular topic)
		> I don't want to harp on about the past
		> you need to stop harping on her age
But even if no one’s wielding the Nets like a cudgel, the perception that their come-up is a net positive — that it’s earned or deserved, as opposed to an instance of “cheating” — certainly colored the reaction to yesterday’s news, which was well-received even by people who otherwise think very little about that franchise. What no one seemed to notice, though, was that Durant, who had been cast as the arch-villain in the last few years’ morality play, was now suddenly thrust into the role of protagonist. Granted, Durant wasn’t the impetus here. Still, he has enthusiastically joined up with the forces of good, been granted their blessings, and, presuming he comes back healthy, get to contend for a title in the East without a dark cloud over him and repair his image, in part by feeding off of the Nets’ reputation. That Durant can go overnight from a villain to hero, from a dastardly “cheater” who kind of got what he deserved to a nice guy that everyone’s pulling for, speaks to what an utter sham The Right Way always is.

But while Durant’s exit to Brooklyn may not be morally coherent, or strike a blow in the name of all that’s supposedly laudable in sports, it still feels, well, right. His departure seemed all but inevitable pre-injury, and the rumors that Durant would re-sign with Golden State never really grew to a din. When the best player in the league leaves its best team, there’s bound to be a dramatic shift in the landscape. What’s yet to really sink in, though, is that the Warriors’ demise was the mechanism that triggered the Nets’ arrival. Without the divisive Warriors and their eventual deterioration, we wouldn’t have gotten a Nets team that, at least preliminarily, we can all agree upon. The end of the Warriors and the beginning of the Nets are one and the same. Golden State can now get to enjoy just being another excellent basketball team and Brooklyn can enjoy this honeymoon until Durant comes back and expectations set in. The part where we judge right and wrong is over for the Nets, and they triumphed, if that sort of thing matters to you.
