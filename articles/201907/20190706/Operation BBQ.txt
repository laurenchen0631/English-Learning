When Natural Disasters Strike, Operation BBQ Swoops In With Relief — And Ribs

Stan Hays was working in insurance in Missouri when the idea first came to him. It was May 2011, and a tornado had just battered the town of Joplin. He felt the urge to help. So he called up a friend, Jeff Stith. Both men shared a common skill: They were pitmasters on competitive barbecue teams.
	- batter
		> 痛打 |Strike repeatedly with hard blows.| a prisoner was battered to death with a table leg
		> 施暴 |Subject (one's spouse, partner, or child) to repeated violence and assault.| the loss of his baby turned him into a domineering bully who battered his partner
		> 嚴厲批評 |Censure, criticize, or defeat severely.| he was battered at times by critics
		> 麵糊 |A semi-liquid mixture of flour, egg, and milk or water, used for making pancakes or for coating food before frying.| pancake batter
		> 打者 |(in various sports, especially baseball) a player who is batting.|
		> 凹陷 |A gradual backwards slope in a wall or similar structure.| the batter is an inch in for every foot of height
		> 凹陷 |(of a wall) have a receding slope.|
	- pitmasters == BBQ Pitmasters == an American reality television series which follows barbecue cooks as they compete for cash and prizes in barbecue cooking competitions.
"I thought, who better than some guys who set up in parking lots every weekend to bring a comfort meal?" Hays says.
They put out a call on social media, and by noon the following day, a dozen of his buddies had answered. The team drove to the town, setting up their smokers amid extensive damage — roofs torn off houses, and entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble. Hays thought they would have a cookout for three or four days before they ran out of supplies. But "whenever we needed something, it seemed to appear," he says. They stayed for 11 days and served 120,000 meals.
	+ amid 在...中 == Surrounded by; in the middle of.
	- rubble 瓦礫堆/粗石 == Waste or rough fragments of stone, brick, concrete, etc., especially as the debris from the demolition of buildings.
	- cookout 野炊派對 == A party or gathering where a meal is cooked and eaten outdoors.
With that, Operation BBQ Relief was born: a roving band of competitive barbecue team members, their loved ones and others traveling to disaster zones across the country, ready to whip up thousands and thousands of hot and tangy meals for people in need. Eight years after that first tornado, the operation has served nearly 3 million meals across 26 states and has "deployed" to 60 disasters.
	- rove
		> 漫無目的地旅行 |Travel constantly without a fixed destination; wander.| he spent most of the 1990s roving about the Caribbean
		> 無目地的旅行 |A journey, especially one with no specific destination; an act of wandering.|
		> 徘徊 |Wander over or through (a place)| children roving the streets
		> 行動的 |Travel for one's work, having no fixed base.| he trained as a roving reporter
		> |(of a person's eyes) look in changing directions in order to see something thoroughly.| the policeman's eyes roved around the pub

		> |Form (slivers of wool, cotton, or other fibre) into roves.|
		> |A small metal plate or ring for a rivet to pass through and be clenched over, especially in boatbuilding.|

		> 趕出來/迅速做 |to make food or a meal very quickly and easily| I have just enough time to whip up an omelette.
	- tangy 撲鼻的 == Having a strong, piquant flavour or smell.
Operation BBQ Relief serves more than ribs and sandwiches, Hays says. "Barbecue is comfort food," he says. "It reminds people of good times with friends and family, and gives them hope for those good times again." Plus, barbecue meals tend to be hearty and high in protein — good for periods of scarcity. Hays says that many of the disaster survivors he serves haven't had a warm meal in days.
Now, Hays has collected recipes from his wide network of competitive barbecuers and Operation BBQ Relief volunteers in a cookbook he co-authored with Tim O'Keefe, a barbecue judge in the Midwest: Operation BBQ: 200 Smokin' Recipes from Competition Grand Champions. The book, which went on sale in April, features recipes from more than 70 teams of championship-winning pitmasters and barbecue cooks, including Hays' 13-year-old daughter, Anna, who started cooking when she was just 6.

Amassing the recipes was challenging, Hays says. "There's two things I always tell people about competition barbecue people," he says. "One, they're very passionate about their cooking. Two, they don't write anything down."
The 200 recipes he managed to get in writing range from fancy competition fare, like smoky tamari-lime tri-tip, to a simple pulled chicken sandwich recipe — reminiscent of the pulled pork version that Operation BBQ Relief volunteers commonly serve at disasters. (Pulled pork sandwiches are affordable, quick to make and easy to eat, Hays says.) The book also includes inspirational stories from volunteer barbecuers about their time helping out. A portion of book proceeds go to Operation BBQ Relief.
	- tamari 醬油 == tamari sauce 
	- lime
		> 石灰 |A white caustic alkaline substance consisting of calcium oxide, which is obtained by heating limestone and which combines with water with the production of much heat; quicklime.|

Everyone involved with Operation BBQ Relief, volunteers and workers say, has at least one "moment" that keeps them hooked on the work.
For Leigh Carnell, the first moment was after Hurricane Harvey, which hit southeast Texas in 2017. "It hit home," she says — literally: She lives in Houston. "I spent 10 days total volunteering. You get hooked; you get addicted. You just want to help more." Then, at her next disaster, she met a family who had lost everything. The mother went up to her after the meal, and hugged her, and started crying. "I hope that meal gave her a sense of peace, a sense of hope," Carnell says.
For Joey Rusek, it was just after he had retired from his job as a criminal investigator in Virginia and started his own barbecue business called Backdraft Barbecue. One afternoon, he and his wife saw a truck driving down the highway on its way to the 2016 West Virginia floods. The side of the truck read: OPERATION BBQ RELIEF, TEXT OBR TO 51555. "So that's what we did," he says. Three years later, he is the operations manager for The Always Serving Project, Operation BBQ Relief's emerging nondisaster program, which visits communities where chronic hunger is more common.
As for Hays, his moment came after that first tornado in Joplin. "Mine is the little old lady who had told us about the tornado and riding out the tornado in her bathroom," he says. "Basically, by the time it was over, there was no roof and she could see the sky and her house was gone."
	- ride out 從...中撐過/倖存 == to succeed in surviving or getting through
		> The ship/crew rode out the storm.
		> We managed to ride out the stock market downturn.
"I just remember her coming up with tears and thanking us for a hot meal," he says. "It was one of the most humbling feelings I've ever had."
	- come up 
		> 走向 |to move towards someone| A young girl came up to me and asked for money.
		> 被提及 |to be mentioned or talked about in conversation| What points came up at the meeting?
		> 出現 |If information comes up on a computer screen, it appears there.|
		> 出現 |If a job or opportunity comes up, it becomes available|
		> 發生 |to happen, usually unexpectedly| I've got to go - something has just come up at home and I'm needed there.
