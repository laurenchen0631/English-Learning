SMALL SOUNDS, BIG MONEY: THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF ASMR

IT WAS TIME to prepare my body for a peaceful, relaxing sleep. So said the voice, in a lilting British accent that barely registered above a whisper. “Notice how soft your pillow feels against your head,” the voice cooed, from my iPhone, in a way that reminded me of having my hair stroked. “You are ready to relax. Nothing is urgent. Everything can wait.”
	- coo
		> 發出咕咕聲 |(of a pigeon or dove) make a soft murmuring sound.| ringdoves cooed among the branche
		> 發出低柔的聲音 |(of a person) speak in a soft gentle voice.| she cooed with delight as he unpacked the bags
	* stroke
		> 擊/打 |An act of hitting or striking someone or something; a blow.| he received three strokes of the cane
		> |Hit or kick (a ball) smoothly and deliberately.|
		> 一筆/筆觸 |A mark made by drawing a pen, pencil, or paintbrush in one direction across paper or canvas.| the paint had been applied in careful, regular strokes
		> 撫/摸 |An act of moving one's hand across a surface with gentle pressure.| massage the cream into your skin using light upward strokes
		> 輕撫 |Move one's hand with gentle pressure over (a surface), typically repeatedly; caress.|
		> |Each of a series of movements in which something moves out of its position and back into it.| the ray swam with effortless strokes of its huge wings

		> 中風 |A sudden disabling attack or loss of consciousness caused by an interruption in the flow of blood to the brain, especially through thrombosis.| he was left disabled by a stroke
The voice came from Mindwell, a new meditation app. For $10 a month, it offers these and other hypnotic monologues, designed to promote peace in both sleep and wakefulness. The app joins a suite of others that reimagine meditation in the digital age: Calm offers relaxation techniques and mindfulness on demand; Headspace, with its guided breathing exercises, delivers zen-like serenity for the price of an Uber. Mindwell does all that stuff, too, but with at least one fresh idea: Its recordings use the brain-melting methods of ASMR.
	- mindfulness
		> 警覺/察覺 |The quality or state of being conscious or aware of something.| their mindfulness of the wider cinematic tradition
		> 入神/冥想 |A mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations, used as a therapeutic technique.|
As an internet curiosity, ASMR — autonomous sensory meridian response — has reached cult-like proportions. There are millions of videos created to encourage the “brain orgasm” that can come from listening to gentle whispers or watching people touch soft objects. The spine shivers, arm hairs stand at attention, and the mind begins to feel delightfully droopy, as if swimming in a warm bath. On YouTube, these videos have grown to constitute an entire genre, ranging from the mundane (hair brushing) to the bizarre (people eating glue sticks). How, exactly, these videos produce the pleasing mind-tingling sensation remains unknown. But they have become enough of a phenomena to sustain a cottage industry of “ASMRtists” who command thousands, if not millions, of blissed-out listeners.
	- meridian
		> 子午線/經線 |A circle of constant longitude passing through a given place on the earth's surface and the terrestrial poles.| the European Broadcasting Area extends from the Atlantic to the meridian 40°E
		> 最高點 |A circle passing through the celestial poles and the zenith of a given place on the earth's surface.|
		> 經脈 |(in acupuncture and Chinese medicine) each of a set of pathways in the body along which vital energy is said to flow.| the slow movements and postures of t'ai chi open up and align the meridians of the body
	* cult /kʌlt/

Where there are followers, of course, there is a market. Companies are now flocking to capitalize on the ASMR craze. Mindwell isn’t even the first: An earlier app called Tingles aimed to be the Twitch of ASMR. (The basic version is free, while “premium” content costs $10 a month.) Silk ASMR offers 300 relaxing soundscapes, ranging from “crinkling” to “grooming sounds,” some of which can be purchased for $1. Ask Alexa to “play ASMR” and you’ll find that a few folks have even built Alexa skills to stream soothing whispers out of your smart speaker.
	- capitalize on 利用…獲益/從…中獲利
		> She capitalized on her knowledge and experience to get a better job.
	- crinkle (n/v)皺/縮/波紋, 發出沙沙聲
Earlier this month, a startup called Acoustic Sheep introduced its first pair of dedicated ASMR headphones, designed to be worn overnight. “We saw a gap in the market for comfortable headphones that let you listen to ASMR without the need to use your phone, listen to ads, or buy a subscription to YouTube Premium,” says Wei-Shin Lai, the product’s creator. “We also saw that ASMR is really taking off.” The headphones, which fit like a fabric headband, can play eight hours of ASMR content, commissioned from over a dozen creators. Tracks include tapping, light scratching, and “peaceful Italian whisperings.”

Is this the Great Commercialization of ASMR? Perhaps so. The type of content that was once made for niche audiences, and largely supported by fans through Patreon accounts, has been reduced to its essential elements, repackaged, and sold back to you for $10 a month.

“It isn't surprising that ASMR has been picked up so quickly, particularly because this work also attracts social media followings,” says Nato Thompson, artistic director of the Philadelphia Contemporary, which organizes pop-up art exhibitions. Thompson created the first ASMR film festival last year and draws a distinction between those who see ASMR content as "art" and those who see its marketing potential. “I would say that there is a big difference, a canyon the size of the Grand Canyon, between the art of someone doing things because they find it interesting, strange, and wild — and the marketing team doing it for the same old reason of making money.”

Is ASMR art? Maybe so, maybe not. Either way, there is a peculiar intimacy in the performance of ASMR. To watch a stranger sweep her face with a large makeup brush, or delicately eat a potato chip, evokes a tenderness that is so often hard to come by online. Many of these creators seem to foster the relationship between viewer and performer — both in the way they structure their videos (talking directly to the camera, sometimes brushing its lens as if it were a person) and in the way they monetize them, often directly through Patreon accounts.
	- tenderness
		> 溫柔/輕切 |Gentleness and kindness; kindliness.| ‘he picked her up in his arms with great tenderness
		> |Feelings of deep affection.| tenderness for the opposite sex
		> 痛覺 |Sensitivity to pain; soreness.| abdominal tenderness
		> 柔軟/嫩 |The quality of being easy to cut or chew; succulence.| steak braised to perfect tenderness in a red-wine-and-brandy sauce
	* come by
		> 順道拜訪 |call casually and briefly as a visitor| his friends came by
		> 設法取得 |manage to acquire or obtain (something).| the remoteness of the region makes accurate information hard to come by
	- monetize
		> 貨幣化 |Convert into or express in the form of currency.| Hamilton had monetized the entire federal and state war debts
		> 從..獲利 |Earn revenue from (an asset, business, etc.)| the company has not said how it expects to monetize the game
It is strange, then, to see a celebrity parrot these rituals — like watching Cardi B run her birdlike nails across a microphone while purring her signature “okurrr” in a voice that never raises above a whisper. Even stranger still to watch the tropes of ASMR reconfigured as commercials, like the Michelob Ultra Pure Gold ad that aired during this year’s Super Bowl. “Beer so pure you can taste it,” whispers Zoë Kravitz, while uncapping the bottle and plinking her fingernails against the glass.
	- parrot (n)鸚鵡 (v)機械式地模仿
	- trope
		> 轉義/比喻 |A figurative or metaphorical use of a word or expression.| ‘my sense that philosophy has become barren is a recurrent trope of modern philosophy

	- plink (n/v)叮噹聲 == Emit a short, sharp, metallic or ringing sound.
Brands capitalizing on the interest around ASMR often do so with a wink, as if to suggest that they, too, are in on the joke. Ikea, which created an ASMR-inspired advertisement in 2017, showcases its dorm room collection by smoothing the bedsheets and gently tapping the duvet, while an off-screen narrator describes each item in a soft voice. A commercial for Behr paint captures the pleasing sounds of a fingernail brushing a color swatch, a wooden stick stirring a can of paint, and a brush slowly coating a wall. It is genuine ASMR, in the sense that it produces a sensation of pleasing calm. It is also a commercial for paint.

	- duvet 鴨絨墊 == A soft quilt filled with down, feathers, or a synthetic fibre, used instead of an upper sheet and blankets.
Monclarity, the company behind the meditation app Mindwell, says the app’s ASMR function is not so much a marketing stunt as it is a genuine attempt to relax people. “We have introduced voices at the level of a whisper, panning between left and right speakers, to give the impression of greater intimacy, as if the person speaking is actually in the room, moving around, creating a sense of companionship, with a view to enhancing calm and relaxation,” says Stewart Lane, the company’s head of mindfulness. This, plus the addition of music set at a tempo of 40 to 60 beats per minute, is in service of “making it easier for listeners to relax or fall asleep.”
	* stunt
		> 妨礙生長 |Prevent from growing or developing properly.| some weeds produce chemicals that stunt the plant's growth

Listening to Mindwell's meditations, I did feel relaxed. The melodic whisper-voice put me into a state of calm bliss, in a way that was no less satisfying than watching a YouTuber tap her fingernails against the microphone, or hearing the soft bristles of a paintbrush coursing against a blank wall.
