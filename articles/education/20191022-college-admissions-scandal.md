---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On a Monday morning in April, 2017, students at Sage Hill School gathered in its artificial-turf *quadrangle*, known as the Town Square, to celebrate seniors who were heading to college as recruited athletes. The ten *honorees* lined up behind an *archway* adorned with balloons. One by one, they stepped forward as their sports and destinations were announced. Patricia Merz, the head of the private high school in Newport Coast, California, placed a *lei* in the appropriate college’s colors around each student’s neck.

Most of the students were recruits to low-profile *Division III* programs. Only three had committed to play *Division I* college sports. Two were the captains of Sage Hill’s girls’ volleyball and girls’ soccer teams, bound for Columbia University and the University of Denver, respectively. The other, Grant Janavs, played tennis. As his shirt and blue-and-gray lei both showed, he would attend Georgetown, the élite Catholic university in Washington, D.C.

The Town Square is framed on three sides by Sage Hill’s gym, library, and administration building. As Adam Langevin watched the ceremony with other seniors, sitting on four rows of steps at the quadrangle’s open end, across from the archway, he was stunned. Adam had been Sage Hill’s top tennis player for four years, and he had lost only three singles matches as a senior. He had trained long hours with renowned coaches, hit with college stars and *budding* *pros*, and *acquitted himself* well in regional and national tournaments. Although his two-handed backhand needed work, Adam had developed a solid serve and a forehand that one of his coaches, the former college and professional player Ross Duncan, described as “pro potential, tour level.” Between tennis and classes, he’d had little time left for other *extracurricular* activities or a social life. In four years, he’d attended only two school dances and had no romantic relationships or even casual lunches with friends. He’d sacrificed it all for his goal of playing for the best Division I college-tennis team he could.

And yet his dream had narrowly eluded him. Although he would likely have played for a weaker Division I program, such as Georgetown, he had his heart set on California Polytechnic State University, which matched his academic interests and is a perennial *contender* in *the Big West Conference*. Unlike Georgetown, California Poly typically ranks among the top seventy-five of the more than two hundred and fifty Division I men’s college-tennis teams in the country. Earlier that month, Adam held back tears when a coach at Cal Poly *phoned* him in calculus class and said that there was no spot left on its team for him. He had been beaten out by players of similar ability whom the coaches had identified as prospects earlier. Desperate to hide his shame and embarrassment from classmates, he immediately fled school. That afternoon, when his father, Rick Langevin, came home, he found Adam sitting on the hood of his car in the driveway, disconsolate.

Now Grant was being celebrated as a future Division I Georgetown tennis player. When Grant had mentioned that he would be playing for Georgetown, Adam had privately thought that Grant was deluding himself. In their freshman year, Grant had played doubles regularly for Sage Hill, but, as the team improved, he lost his starting position. As a senior, Grant wasn’t even on the team. He hit the ball hard but sprayed his shots outside the lines; he couldn’t stay in a rally for more than three or four *strokes*. Grant had a private coach who went to his matches and practices, but he still didn’t get better. Adam sometimes wondered if Grant would prefer playing for fun rather than competing.

“I must admit it. I was jealous,” Adam recalled in June, as he sprawled on a couch in the living room of his family’s home, part of a residential development on a *bluff* overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Five feet ten and a sturdy hundred and fifty-five pounds, Adam wore white socks without sneakers because he was recovering from surgery for an *ingrown toenail*, a common tennis malady. “He was living my dream after I worked for so many years,” Adam told me. “I was known as the tennis kid. That’s what I did. Grant gets up there, and I felt people looking over. ‘Why aren’t you up there?’ The whole team was, like, ‘What?’ It was really, really frustrating.”

A. G. Longoria, who served as Sage Hill’s tennis coach from the school’s founding, in 2000, to his retirement, in 2015, coached both players. Adam “was the better athlete and devoted much more time to tennis as this was his number one passion — he was in an elite tennis academy, had high performance coaches and played USTA tournaments almost every week,” Longoria told me in an e-mail. “He got good *in a hurry*” and “could have played at Georgetown.” By contrast, “Grant was limited by his form (strokes) which all his coaches tried to correct but either he could not or would not change them. I am guessing that Adam was surprised, as many were, that Grant was going to play for Georgetown.”

When Adam told his parents that Grant was a Georgetown tennis recruit, his father speculated that Grant’s billionaire family had endowed a building at the university. Grant’s mother, Michelle Janavs, is the daughter of Paul Merage, who, with his brother, co-founded Chef America Inc., which created the Hot Pockets microwavable snack. Universities frequently reward donors by giving their children or grandchildren an *edge* in admissions.

Nearly two years later, in March, 2019, the actual explanation emerged. An independent college-admissions *counsellor* named William (Rick) Singer *pleaded* guilty in a federal court in Boston to fraud, *racketeering*, money laundering, and obstruction of justice in a case known as Operation *Varsity* Blues. Singer’s clients had paid him more than twenty-five million dollars to help their children enter an array of selective colleges with bogus credentials. He bribed college coaches and athletic officials to misrepresent students as recruited athletes, and he paid *proctors* at testing sites to improve their scores on the SAT or ACT by secretly correcting wrong answers.

One billionaire family paid Singer $6.5 million for their daughter’s admission to Stanford. Her application to Stanford was embellished with false credentials for the sailing team, according to a court filing by prosecutors. The university expelled the student, according to news reports, but she and her parents have not been charged in the case. Stanford’s sailing coach, who pleaded guilty, admitted to taking bribes to help some of Singer’s clients, but he spent the money on the sailing program rather than himself. The thirty-three parents who were charged included the television actresses Lori Loughlin, who pleaded not guilty, and Felicity Huffman, who apologized and was sentenced to fourteen days in prison. There were also two Sage Hill *trustees*: Douglas Hodge, the former chief executive of Pacific Investment Management Company, or PIMCO, one of the world’s largest bond managers, and Grant’s mother, Michelle Janavs.

In May, 2017, after Georgetown admitted Grant, a foundation controlled by his grandfather had wired four hundred thousand dollars to a California nonprofit that Singer had set up — the Key Worldwide Foundation, according to court documents. Prosecutors said that Singer, through that foundation, paid Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst more than $2.7 million in “consulting” fees to designate at least a dozen applicants, including Grant, as tennis recruits. Ernst, who declined to comment through his lawyer, pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy. Grant was not charged in the case, and no evidence has emerged that he knew or suspected anything inappropriate regarding his recruitment. His mother and Singer appear to have engineered his acceptance to Georgetown without him being aware of their alleged scheme.

Michelle Janavs’s alleged bribes continued after Georgetown admitted Grant. She paid two hundred thousand dollars for her older daughter to get into the University of Southern California for beach volleyball, according to prosecutors. (The daughter had been on Sage Hill’s junior-varsity team.) She paid another hundred thousand dollars to *rig* both of her daughters’ standardized-test scores: a proctor on Singer’s payroll corrected their answers so that their scores would be within a preselected range. Janavs pleaded not guilty to conspiring to commit *mail and wire fraud* and money laundering. (Her lawyers declined to comment. Grant did not respond to requests for comment.)

Media coverage of Operation Varsity Blues has highlighted the accused celebrities, tycoons, and coaches. The *culpability* of the students who gained admission has also been widely debated: Did they know of the bribery, or were they deceived by their own parents, like Grant? The élite colleges involved have portrayed themselves as helpless victims. In reality, they created the conditions for Singer’s scheme, from the lower admissions standards for athletes to the ever-increasing *selectivity* that *ratchets up* parents’ desperation. They’ve *tacitly* sold admissions slots for decades to major donors, yet *professed* shock that their coaches would as well.

Less understood is that the repercussions extended beyond the families and colleges entangled in the scandal. The true victims were other, and perhaps more deserving, high-school students and athletes, like Adam. For every student like Grant who benefitted from Singer’s crimes, there was a student who aspired to attend *premier* schools and sports programs. Despite their stronger credentials, some were rejected. To students like Adam, the scandal shows that the college-admissions game offers shortcuts, but only for the wealthy and well-connected. “Grant is a nice person, but he’s a god-awful tennis player,” Adam told me. “I knew he wouldn’t see a day on court. He would never play a match for Georgetown.”

*In the wake of* Rick Singer’s guilty plea, media reports portrayed him as a criminal mastermind who deftly hid his activities. He shrewdly exploited procedures that were vulnerable to abuse — such as college-admissions committees taking a coach’s word for an applicant’s athletic *prowess*. But Singer didn’t fool everyone. Long before 2011, when court documents indicate that his bribing of coaches and test administrators began, he was notorious among some guidance counsellors and college advisers for boosting students’ chances by pretending that they were racial minorities or by burnishing their extracurricular activities. Singer had a white applicant identify himself as *Hispanic* to qualify for *affirmative* action, a former business associate told me. “It blew up,” this person said, after “the college questioned it because he didn’t put it on the SATs,” which ask about ethnicity. Many of Singer’s associates — other independent counsellors, high-school guidance counsellors, his own employees — suspected him of cheating. At least one prep school banned him from its campus.

It didn’t matter. Singer knew how to *appeal* to the panic of wealthy parents who fear that their children will not get into exclusive universities. He promised the certainty they craved, and at a bargain price compared with the legal donation needed to improve their chances. In 1994, Singer, a former high-school and college basketball coach, established *Sacramento’s* first independent college-counsellor business. A pioneer in the high-priced field of coaching college applicants, Singer helped upend the admissions process by increasing the advantage enjoyed by the affluent. Soon well-off parents — doctors, lawyers, businesspeople — were clamoring, and paying, for his advice. What he lacked in expertise, he made up for in *chutzpah*. “I did see him tell a kid, ‘You mind if I put in your application you were in the Key Club?’ ” the former associate recalled. When Singer requested brochures from colleges, he told them that he was working with more than five hundred students; the actual number was about fifty. “He did embellish, even back then,” the former associate said.

Margie Amott, another independent counsellor in Sacramento, said that she knew a parent who hired Singer. The mother was astonished when Singer revamped her son’s college application, claiming that he had organized a fantasy football league, marketed an international blog on social responsibility, written several short films for television, spoken Spanish at home, ranked as a top-fifty junior tennis player, and coördinated the basketball program at Helen Keller Park. None of it was true, and there was no such park in Sacramento. The mother paid Singer’s bill, stopped working with him, and had her son fill out the application accurately.

In 2004, Singer burnished his credibility by assembling an *advisory board* for his counselling firm, CollegeSource. The board included five higher-education *heavyweights*: William Bowen, Donald Kennedy, and Ted Mitchell — the former presidents of Princeton, Stanford, and Occidental College, respectively — as well as the former U.C.L.A. *chancellor* Charles Young, and the former Princeton *dean* of admission Fred Hargadon. In January, 2008, more than a decade before Singer’s guilty plea, Jon Reider, then the director of college counselling at San Francisco University High School and a former senior admissions officer at Stanford, e-mailed Kennedy, Hargadon, and Mitchell and urged them to stop working with Singer.

“Do you want to be associated with this guy? He is the *epitome* of *sleaze* in the private counseling business,” Reider wrote. “How did he get your names onto his website? There are some decent independent counselors, but he isn’t one of them . . . . .We can’t stop this guy, but we can slow him down a bit.”

Reider knew all three of the prominent administrators from his time at Stanford. Hargadon had been Stanford’s dean of admission before moving to Princeton, and Mitchell had earned three Stanford degrees and been Kennedy’s deputy. Mitchell’s response disappointed him. “I strongly disagree that Rick is the ‘epitome of sleaze,’ ” Mitchell replied to Reider. “Don and I got involved with Rick when he was trying to get college access info to poor kids and ‘break the code,’ for kids who didn’t have access to private counseling. . . Do you know Rick? He’s a decent guy, Jon, and I’d love to find a time to introduce the two of you.” Reider pushed back. “There are ways to go about this business in an ethical way, so that you do not earn the disapproval of other professionals. I am the tip of the iceberg.”

Mitchell went on to serve as the U.S. Under-Secretary of Education in the Obama Administration and the president of the American Council on Education, a higher-education lobbying group. When asked for comment after Singer pleaded guilty, Mitchell downplayed his ties to the disgraced counsellor, saying that he “served briefly nearly fifteen years ago in an unpaid role in an advisory board of one of his previous ventures.” Mitchell also expressed surprise, saying that he was “shocked, sad, and angry that someone I thought I knew could perpetrate these crimes.”

In 2012, as he was carrying out what would become the biggest college-admissions scandal in the country, Singer relocated from Sacramento to Newport Beach, where the Langevins lived. Adam Langevin was then a middle-school student striving to become a tennis star. At the age of four, he had taken his first tennis lesson. By the time he turned eight, the court was the only place he wanted to be. He trained four to five hours every other day at an academy run by Phil, Taylor, and Jenny Dent — a father, son, and daughter-in-law who had all been ranked among the top sixty players in the world. In 2010, Taylor Dent had blasted the fastest serve ever at Wimbledon — a hundred and forty-eight miles per hour. The Dents’ academy practiced at the same club where the Sage Hill varsity tennis team trained. Adam sometimes hit with high-school players who were four to five years older than him, which improved his game. When Adam began playing tournaments, he found that he also loved competing. “I just enjoyed being out there,” he said.

Adam’s father, Rick, a *realtor* and recreational tennis player, and his mother, Alisa, a homemaker, encouraged his passion for the game. Unlike some tennis parents, they prioritized education as well. Neither Rick nor Alisa had graduated from college, and they hoped that Adam would do so. “He’s extremely academic,” Alisa told me. “I felt that also needed to be nourished.” Until Adam entered ninth grade, they didn’t let him have a cell phone and limited his television viewing to an hour a day. He listened to audiobooks about world history and Greek mythology. As a seventh grader, Adam startled one of Rick’s real-estate clients, who was purchasing a seventeen-thousand-square-foot home with outdoor pools and a movie theatre, by identifying a painting on the ceiling as a copy of Raphael’s “The School of *Athens*” and the figures in a back-yard sculpture as *Pygmalion* and *Galatea*.

As a child, Adam dreamed of turning pro, but, as that began to seem unrealistic, he switched his sights to playing Division I college tennis. Players with such lofty goals are often homeschooled so they have more time to practice and travel to national tournaments. When Adam asked his parents if they would consider homeschooling, they pointed out that he also loved science and might make a career of it. Sage Hill, which opened a science center with seven labs and four classrooms, in 2014, offered a far superior academic program to anything available online.

After Adam enrolled at Sage Hill, he initially *balked* at joining its tennis team. College coaches, he knew, pay scant attention to high-school matches. They notice tournament results and the Universal Tennis Rating, or U.T.R., which enables them to compare U.S. and international prospects. But his father told him that, as Sage Hill’s top player, he had to support his school. For the next four years, high-school and tournament practices and matches consumed Adam’s time.

In the 2017 Sage Hill *yearbook*, seniors were asked what they would like to say to their future selves. The responses from Grant and Adam were strikingly different. “Nothing because the future is going to be great,” Grant wrote. “You worked so impossibly hard to get where you are,” Adam wrote. “Remember that.” Their divergent attitudes were also reflected in their approach to academics and athletics. William Dupuis, who taught chemistry at Sage Hill and had both young men in class, said that Grant *scraped by* with B’s in first-year chemistry. Adam was “very good, very hard-working.”

Longoria, the former Sage Hill coach, used a startling expression to convey how much Adam sacrificed for the sport. He “suicided” tennis, Longoria said. “He was all in.” Already the team’s best player as a freshman, Adam steadily improved, and his skill and drive set an example for his teammates. As a junior, he damaged a tendon in his left *wrist*, rendering him unable to hit his normal two-handed backhand. Instead of sitting out matches, he donned a brace and played doubles for Sage Hill, protecting his wrist by serving and volleying, and slicing the few backhands he couldn’t avoid. Adam enjoyed encouraging others. “My intensity for the sport got a lot of guys playing tournaments,” he told me. Rival coaches noticed. “He was a top-notch player and a great kid,” said T. J. Reynolds, the coach of Crean Lutheran High School, in nearby Irvine. “He stood out as a freshman to me. He was *relentless*, he would never give up. He played with a lot of intensity. As he got older, he started adding offense to his game.” A junior tennis Web site assessed Adam as a three-star recruit (out of five stars) and ranked him a hundred and thirty-fifth nationally in 2017.

Grant was less *single-minded* about tennis. He enjoyed other *pastimes*, like surfing. His response to a yearbook question about his bucket list suggested a thirst for adventure. Grant said that he hoped to *skydive*, ride an elephant, and send a message in a bottle. Longoria said that Grant couldn’t or wouldn’t change his unorthodox tennis strokes. He “hit a wall” and was replaced in the starting lineup. Longoria credited Grant for being “very ethical” and a “great competitor.” Once, Sage Hill’s hopes of defeating another school rested on a *tiebreaker* in Grant’s match. In the key rally, **Grant made a correct line call *in favor of* his opponent on a close shot, depriving Sage Hill of victory. “Ninety per cent of kids” would have called it the other way, Longoria, who is now a consultant to Sage Hill’s tennis program, said.**

Grant’s mother supported the team and appeared to respect boundaries. “She opened up her beach house for team barbecues,” Longoria said. Like other parents, “she bought a lot of things for the team. But she never said, ‘I want my son to start.’ ” *It didn’t occur to* the coach that she might find another way to burnish Grant’s tennis résumé.

In 2000, a group of Orange County parents and community leaders opened Sage Hill, the first nondenominational, nonprofit private high school on the Southern California coast between *Irvine* and *San Juan Capistrano*. Nestled in the hills above the Pacific Ocean, with a clock tower and *low-slung* concrete buildings painted to look like terra-cotta, Sage Hill quickly gained a reputation for academic excellence. It also thrived financially. As of June, 2017, its net assets were $76.3 million. Depending on market conditions, its endowment fluctuates between $18 million and $20 million. The former Major League Baseball commissioner and U.S. Olympic Committee chairman Peter Ueberroth was integral to the school’s founding. The Sage Hill gym, known as the Ube, is named after him, and his daughter served as the chair of the school’s board. Current Sage Hill parents include the former Los Angeles Lakers *standout* Kobe Bryant, whose daughter Natalia plays volleyball for the school. “Most of the billionaires in Newport have a child or grandchild at Sage,” Adam’s father, Rick Langevin, told me.

At first, Sage Hill was strict with donors. It didn’t let them dictate how their money would be spent. When Bryant offered to fund a gym if he could practice there at night, the school *turned him down*, according to Longoria, the former tennis coach. Over time, financial pressures caused the school to loosen its approach. Today, buildings, classrooms, locker rooms, and sports facilities are named for donors — with exceptions, such as the A. G. Longoria Center Court, which honors the ex-coach’s service. The exterior wall of the Sage Hill Athletic Complex displays sixty disks of varying sizes, with donors’ names printed on them. One of the largest is labelled “Merage Family Janavs Family.” In 2014, the year after Grant enrolled in Sage Hill, a foundation operated by his mother, Michelle Janavs, donated $82,500 to Sage Hill, and she became a trustee. After her two daughters also enrolled at Sage Hill, Janavs gave the school another $190,000. Torrey Olins, the school’s spokesperson, declined to comment on “rumors about who may or may not have considered making donations for our facilities.” She said that the school has “always recognized those who donate money, time, or talents to our community.”

Ninety per cent of Sage Hill’s almost five hundred and fifty students pay the school’s roughly forty-thousand-dollar-a-year tuition. Ten per cent receive financial aid. A former student who received financial aid told me that many classmates donned expensive brand-name clothes and a few wore a different outfit every day. A May, 2018, article in the student newspaper accused the school of grade inflation. The story, headlined “Inflated Grades, Inflated *Egos*, Inflated Futures,” reported that seventy to seventy-five per cent of all grades given in the previous semester were A’s or A-minuses. There were few C’s, and no D’s or F’s. Teachers told the newspaper that the school initially had rigorous academic standards, and that the soaring grades were a response to parental pressure and diminished enrollment caused by the 2008-9 financial crisis. “I remember when I got my first B, I was so surprised,” a 2017 graduate, Andrea Flores, told me in an interview. “I didn’t know they gave B’s.”
